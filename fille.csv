330,Phil," Oh, sorry. I'm a real-estate mogul. What?! No, I am a realestate agent. We caravanned that house.Great deck.",,,
331,Desiree, Thanks. I'm just there till my divorce is final.,,,
332,Phil," Now, who is conuts enough to divorce you?",,,
333,Claire," We got to go, but we'll see you around.",,,
334,Phil, We'll have to have you over sometime.,,,
335,Desiree, I'd love it.,,,
336,Phil, She's awesome. ,,,
337,Claire, We are never having her over.I heard she already slept with two dads from the school.,,,
338,Phil, What? That's... horrible.,,,
339,Luke, Dad! Watch out.,,,
340,Phil," Watch it, buddy.",,,
341,Luke, Grandma.,,,
342,Phil, I'm sorry. That still looks like a girl's bike.,,,
343,Claire, We'll add more black tape.,,,
344,Phil, My son has been riding his sister's old bike.,,,
345,Claire, Until he's responsible enough to take care of his own bike.He spilled a soda on my computer.He ruined our digital camera taking pictures of himself underwater.,,,
346,Phil," It's a girl's bike. I'm all for teaching him a lesson,but I worry about the ridicule he might get from some loudmouth bully.",,,
347,Jay," Nice bike, Sally.",,,
348,Claire, Dad!,,,
349,Jay, He looks like Little Bo Peep.,,,
350,Phil," Actually, not for long.He's getting a new bike this afternoon",,,
351,Luke, I am?,,,
352,Claire, He is ?,,,
353,Phil, Sometimes a man's gotta put his foot down and do what a man's gotta do.And if the old lady don't like it... Honey?... that's too damn bad.,,,
354,Mitchell," Yes! Who's excited, huh? Cam, hurry up. We're gonna be late.",,,
355,Cam," It's a toddler play class, not a flight to Cabo.",,,
356,Mitchell," We're gonna be judged as the only gay parents. I don't want to be late, too.Paisley and pink. Was there something wrong with the fishnet tank top?",,,
357,Cam, Obviously not. I'm wearing it underneath. Kidding.,,,
358,Mitchell," Just chill, please. I'm sorry. I just want to make a good first impression.",,,
359,Cam, You mean you want to fit in and not terrify the villagers?  ,,,
360,Mitchell," Today is about Lily, all right? Her future best friend might be in that class, and I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way.Can you please just... change your shirt?",,,
361,Cam," Fine. You know what? I'll just go put on a pair of khakis, a polo shirt, and everybody will think we're a couple straight golfing buddies who just decided to have a kid together.",,,
362,Jay," I called that place in Napa and got us upgraded to a villa with a hot tub, so pack whatever you wear in a hot tub.",,,
363,Gloria, I usually wear nothing when I'm in a hot tub.,,,
364,Jay, And my college roommate's wife just had to get a new hip. Sucker.,,,
365,Gloria," Manny's father is taking him for a couple of days to Disneyland, so we're gonna go...to the wine country! We're gonna drink some wine, eat some good food.",,,
366,Jay, We would do something like this a lot more often if it wasn't for Manny.,,,
367,Gloria, It's good.He keeps us grounded.,,,
368,Jay, Like fog at airport.,,,
369,Jay,,"00. I thought I'd go to the club, hit a few balls.",,
370,Gloria, What about the fan in Manny's room?,,,
371,Jay, Call a guy.,,,
372,Gloria," No! You're supposed to do it with him. It's important that we teach him how to do things for himself. In my culture, men take great pride in doing physical labor.",,,
373,Jay, That's why I hire people from your culture.,,,
374,Gloria, You're too funny! I'll share that one with my next husband when we're spending all your money.,,,
375,Luke," Dad, this is the coolest bike ever.",,,
376,Phil," Awesome. So, listen, buddy. Certains members of this family don't think you can take care of this bad boy.",,,
377,Luke, You mean mom?,,,
378,Phil," Your words, not mine.Look, your mom and I are a team, and she... we feel like this is a chance for you to show some responsibility. Don't make us look like jerks here.",,,
379,Luke, I won't. ,,,
380,Phil, One more rule.,,,
381,Luke, What?,,,
382,Phil," Have, like, three buttloads of fun.",,,
383,Luke," Thanks, Dad.",,,
384,Jay," So, let's do this.",,,
385,Manny,,00.That's when my dad's picking me up.,,
386,Jay,,"00, I'm gonna tie a noose on this thing.",,
387,Gloria," In Colombia, there's a saying.If you have two stubborn burros that don't like each other, you tie them to the same cart.The ceiling fan is the cart.",,,
388,Manny," My dad's taking me on Space Mountain.It's supposed to be really fast, but he's not scared of anything.He doesn't even wear a seat belt when he drives.",,,
389,Jay, How about that?,,,
390,Manny, He killed a bear once.,,,
391,Jay, Was the bear in the passenger seat? Read me the instructions.,,,
392,Manny," ""Safety tips. Warning. To avoid electrical shock...""",,,
393,Jay, We can skip that.,,,
394,Manny," ""Failure to heed these warnings can lead to serious injury or death...""",,,
395,Jay, You worry too much. You know that. Nobody's gonna get shocked.,,,
396,Manny," One time, my dad was struck by lightning. That's why he can drink as much as he wants.",,,
397,Jay," Manny thinks his dad is like Superman. The truth? He's a total flake. In fact, the only way he's like Superman is that they both landed in this country illegally.",,,
398,Mitchell, I'm so nervous.,,,
399,Cam, They're gonna love us.Let's just be ourselves.,,,
400,Mitchell," Or a slightly toned-down version of ourselves. I just don't want this to become an episode of ""The Cam Show.""",,,
401,Cam," People love ""The Cam Show."" You do.",,,
402,Mitchell," Yes, I do watch it.",,,
403,Cam, It's appointment viewing.,,,
404,The teacher, Hi! Are you here for toddler time? ,,,
405,Mitchell," Yes, I'm Mitchell, this is Cameron,and this here is Lily.",,,
406,The teacher, Welcome. We're all over here taking turns blowing bubbles.,,,
407,Cam," Well, how nice for...the babies. This is gonna be really difficult.",,,
408,Phil," 10 minutes after making a promise to me, he leaves his bike unlocked. All I can hear is Claire's voice in my head. ""He's not responsible. You never should have given him a bike."" I know. I do a pretty good Claire. So I decided to teach him a lesson and let him think his bike was stolen. I know that sounds kind of rough, but sometimes it's a dad's job to be the tough guy. Excuse me. Thank you. On your left.My left, your right.",,,
409,The teacher," Everyone, we have a new family join us today.",,,
410,Mitchell," I'm Mitchell, and I am a lawyer.",,,
411,Cameron," I'm Cameron, and I'm currently not working, which gives me more time to grill and shoot baskets,and...",,,
412,Mitchell, And this is Lily.,,,
413,The teacher," We're gonna start with the hello dance, and then we're gonna move on to blocks and finger painting, and then we're gonna do our family dance. All right, who wants to start us off? Dance us in, P.J.!",,,
414,Tyler's mother, She's adorable.,,,
415,Mitchell," Oh, thank you.",,,
416,Tyler's mother, 7 months?,,,
417,Mitchell, 8.,,,
418,Tyler's mother, Is she grabbing or scooting yet?,,,
419,Mitchell," Yes, absolutely. I mean, when she's not grabbing, she is scootin'.",,,
420,The teacher," Dance us in, Tyler!",,,
421,Tyler's mother," Are you ready? Okay, here we go!",,,
422,Mitchell," Cam, Lily is not grabbing or scooting yet.",,,
423,Cam," Well, she's not doing it yet, but she will eventually.",,,
424,Mitchell," No, a lot of these other kids,they're... they're grabbing. Here, Lily, look at the block. Grab the block, Lily. Grab the ""H.""",,,
425,The teacher,"Dance us in, Lily! ",,,
426,Cam," I got this.Yes, I know. Tamp down my natural gifts and dance like a straight guy.",,,
427,Mitchell, No slapping your own butt.,,,
428,Cam, But that's how I make my horsey go.,,,
429,The teacher, Thank you.,,,
430,Mitchell, That was very good.,,,
431,Cam, I feel dirty.,,,
432,Desiree," This is really embarrassing, but I locked myself out of my house.",,,
433,Phil, I do it all the time.Don't be embarrassed.,,,
434,Desiree," I was hoping you could help me. There's a window open, but I can't reach it. Would you mind?",,,
435,Phil," Sure. Of course. You know what they say. Every time God closes a door, he opens a window. Or I guess in this case, every time he locks you out. Okay, what do we got here?",,,
436,Phil, Am I attracted to her? Yes. Would I ever act on it? No. No way. Not while my wife is still alive.,,,
437,Desiree, Are you sure I can't get you something to drink?,,,
438,Phil," I'm fine, really.",,,
439,Desiree," If I knew a man was gonna climb into my bedroom window, I'd have cleaned up.",,,
440,Phil," Are you kidding me? It smelled great in there,like lotions and oils. For... dry skin and, you know, calloused hands.",,,
441,Desiree," Yeah, it's a candle.What's wrong?",,,
442,Phil, The bike's gone.,,,
443,Desiree, Can I help you find it?,,,
444,Phil, That's all right. Thank you.,,,
445,Desiree, Thank you!,,,
446,Phil," So, to teach him a lesson, I took his bike, and then... crazy thing... I put it down for one minute, and someone swiped it from me.",,,
447,The trader, Maybe that was your dad teaching you a lesson.,,,
448,Phil," Zinger! So, any chance I could get a break on this one?",,,
449,The trader, I can throw in a bell.,,,
450,Phil, Deal.,,,
451,The trader, For $5. ,,,
452,Phil," No, sir.",,,
453,The trader," So, you want to go for the insurance this time, or is it still for suckers?",,,
454,Phil," Got me again. Well played, milord. I will take some insurance. Thank you.",,,
455,Gloria, What's going on in there?,,,
456,Manny, That's not step 4.,,,
457,Jay, Don't worry about it.,,,
458,Manny," Well, it says right here that...",,,
459,Jay, That's worrying about it.,,,
460,Gloria, I thought you guys might need a drink.,,,
461,Jay, You have no idea.,,,
462,Gloria," Manny, mi amor, I have to go get some stuff for our trip. Ay, but have some fun with your father, okay? And I'll see you Monday.Makes me so happy to see my two boys working together.",,,
463,Manny, Jay shocked himself twice.,,,
464,Jay," Okay, Manny.",,,
465,Manny," Well, I warned him.",,,
466,Jay," Yep, he's been a big help.",,,
467,Gloria, Look at you two with your private jokes already. You're a regular Salazar and El Oso.,,,
468,Gloria," It's a very big comedy team in Colombia. El Oso is always hitting Salazar in the head with the ladder and things, and sometimes they wear dresses. They make you laugh, but they also make you think.",,,
469,Phil," ""You blew it. You made me look bad."" No, ""you made your mother and I look bad. We are a team.""Luke, you in there?",,,
470,Luke," Hey, Dad.",,,
471,Phil," Hey, buddy.That was pretty fun today, huh, gettin' a new bike?",,,
472,Luke," Yeah, it was awesome.",,,
473,Phil," So, what happened after I took off? Anything you want to share with me?",,,
474,Luke, Not really. ,,,
475,Phil," So if I went out to the garage to take a picture for the scrapbook,there'd be no surprises?",,,
476,Luke, I'm so sorry.I didn't mean it. I just made a mistake.,,,
477,Phil," Yeah, a big mistake! You're making me look really bad here.I told mom you were ready for this.",,,
478,Luke, It's just a scratch.,,,
479,Phil," That's not the point, Luke... What?",,,
480,Luke, I scratched it on my way into the driveway. I'm sorry.,,,
481,Phil, So... it's not stolen?,,,
482,Luke, No. Why?,,,
483,Phil," That's good, 'cause...There are bad people out there who would steal a bike. Thieves.You think about the scratch part.That's not good, either.Gonna fix that step. Don't scratch anything while I'm gone. Unless it itches, that's different.",,,
484,Phil," The good news is, Luke has his bike. More good news...I taught some random kid a valuable lesson by stealing his bike. Best news...Claire knows nothing.So,I figure I'll just dump the new bike where I stole the first bike.That way, random kid gets his back, and this new bike doesn't raise a lot of embarrassing questions,like why I had it or who boosted who through a bedroom window. So, everybody's happy.",,,
485,Jay," Oh, son of a...You gave me the wrong screwdriver.",,,
486,Manny, Maybe you're just using it wrong. My dad's great with tools. He can get the wheels off a car in a minute.,,,
487,Jay, Just get me to wine country. Just get me to wine...Sorry.,,,
488,Manny, I think my arm is broken.,,,
489,Jay, Relax. It's not broken.,,,
490,Manny, How do you know? You don't know anything! You have no concern for safety.,,,
491,Jay, Because it didn't hit you that hard.,,,
492,Manny, Why don't you just say it? You don't want me around.,,,
493,Jay," You know what? Right now, I don't.",,,
494,Manny," I don't want to be with you, either. I'm gonna go wait for my dad.",,,
495,Jay," But if you leave,how will I ever finish? ",,,
496,Manny, You know what? I wish you never married my mom.I hate living here.,,,
497,Jay, You think I like this arrangement? I got a two-seater parked in the driveway.,,,
498,Claire, I don't understand.Why do you sneak around and hide things from me? I actually think it's funny.,,,
499,Phil, You do?,,,
500,Claire," I do, yes.I mean, you steal a bike from some poor kid and then the bike gets stolen from you.That's hilarious.",,,
501,Phil," Classic me, right?",,,
502,Claire," So, where were you when it got stolen?",,,
503,Phil, I was getting some gas.,,,
504,Claire, You don't stand near the car when you get gas?,,,
505,Phil," I went inside to get a soda because I was thirsty, and if I had a soda I wouldn't be thirsty anymore, so I bought one, and then I drank it there, which is why I don't have the can.",,,
506,Claire," Honey, please, let's try to remember that I'm your wife, not your mom,so in the future, you don't need to hide things from me, okay?",,,
507,Phil," You get back here, you!",,,
508,Claire," What are you doing, Phil?",,,
509,Phil, I just love you so darn much!,,,
510,Claire," I love you, too, but that hurts.",,,
511,Phil, Let's get you inside. It is a hot one.,,,
512,Claire, I know. That's hurting a lot.,,,
513,Desiree," Hi, again. I found your bike.",,,
514,Phil," Oh, good! You...At the gas station?",,,
515,Desiree," No, at my house. My neighbor put it in my garage when you were in my bedroom, so...",,,
516,Phil, Classic me?,,,
517,Mitchell," Come on, honey, grab the block. See, like he did. You got to do that. You got to grab it like him.",,,
518,Cam, You seen any movies lately?,,,
519,Tyler's mother," You know, my husband and I just rented ""Mamma Mia,"",which I liked, but... I don't know that Meryl Streep was the right choice. What did you think? ",,,
520,Cam," Excuse me... Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice.She's perfection,whether she's divorcing Kramer, whether she's wearing Prada. Don't even get me started on ""Sophie's Choice.""I get emotional thinking about it. She couldn't forgive herself.",,,
521,Cam, I guess she was okay.,,,
522,Tyler's mother, Really? Ugh.,,,
523,Mitchell," Grab the block, sweetheart.You're not even interested in it.",,,
524,The teacher," Is Henry stacking? Good job, Henry! Good job!",,,
525,Mitchell," Q, R, S,T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z Not so high!",,,
526,The teacher, That is a big moment for her. Would you like a videotape?,,,
527,Mitchell," I don't know if I can actually get her to do it again, so...",,,
528,The teacher," Well, we tape all of our classes. We don't like parents bringing cameras. It takes them out of the moment. I'll get you a copy after class.",,,
529,Mitchell," That's super. Thank you.Cam, let's go.I don't know what's happened to me, but I just stole a baby's intellectual property.",,,
530,Cam, What? You'll see it tonight on the news. Go.,,,
531,The teacher, Look who's here.Anton and Scott!,,,
532,A gay parent, Sorry we're late! Don't look at me. The eye candy here can't leave the house without spending 20 minutes in front of the mirror.,,,
533,Cam, Are you kidding me?,,,
534,Mitchell, I am so sorry.,,,
535,Cam," Look at those queens.I would have killed with this crowd, but you had to clip my wings, which you used to be the wind beneath.",,,
536,Mitchell, I know. Sorry. This class has turned me into a complete monster.I'll make it up to you. Let's just go.,,,
537,The teacher, It's time for parents dance! Everybody dance for your baby!,,,
538,Mitchell," You want to do it, don't you?",,,
539,Cam, I do.I want to dance for my baby. ,,,
540,Mitchell," Go on, get in there.",,,
541,Cam, You sure? Make that horsey move.Go ahead.I think I hurt myself.,,,
542,Jay," Hello. Hey, Javier. Manny's waiting for you outside. What? Why not? Hold that thought.",,,
543,Jay," His son's sitting on a curb, waiting to go to Disneyland,and Superman can't drag himself away from a craps table.And I'm the jerk.",,,
544,Jay," Say, listen... I, uh...Sorry, but I got some bad news.",,,
545,Manny, What?,,,
546,Jay, Your dad couldn't make it.,,,
547,Manny, Why not?,,,
548,Jay," The plane was full,and this old lady needed to get home,so he gave up his seat.",,,
549,Manny," You're making that up, aren't you? He just didn't want to come.",,,
550,Jay," Are you kidding me? He was very upset.He was dying to see you.In fact, look what he sent.",,,
551,Manny, A limo?,,,
552,Jay, He wanted me and your mom to take you to Disneyland.,,,
553,Manny, I told you he was an awesome dad.,,,
554,Jay," Yeah, he's a prince.",,,
555,Jay, The key to being a good dad? Sometimes things work out just the way you want.,,,
556,Luke, Race you to the end.,,,
557,Phil, That is not a good idea... for you.,,,
558,Jay, Sometimes they don't. You got to hang in there...Because when all is said and done...90% of being a dad...Just showing up.,,,
559,A boy, That's my bike!,,,
560,Phil," I don't, uh... I was giving it back!",,,
561,Cam," She couldn't forgive herself. She had to choose. And I think because now I have... We have... we have... We have Lily,it's so hard to imagine being put in that position.If I had to choose Lily or Mitchell, I mean, I would choose Li...I don't know! I just... I don't know! I don't know!  Modern Family",,,
562,Claire ," Hey, I though you were gonna take out the garbage.",,,
563,Phil , I am.,,,
564,Claire , Phil.,,,
565,Phil ," Yes, getting it. I was... I was gonna get it.",,,
566,Claire , Dylan.,,,
567,Dylan ," Hey, mrs. Dunphy. Um, I'm just waiting for haley.",,,
568,Claire , Did you ring the bell?,,,
569,Dylan , I texted. She said she'd be down in just a minute.,,,

575,Dylan ," Oh, I'm not really a baseball guy. Haley says hi.",,,
576,Claire , I-I was just being facetious.,,,
577,Phil ," Come on. I'll catch you up. Sit it. Park it. Come on, I don't bite. kidding. I'm kidding. Okay, see that guy? He's the tying run. Interesting story about him. He's been stuck on second base forever, And I'm pretty sure he's gonna try and steal third, which is just a terrible, terrible idea. How are you and Haley doing?",,,
578,Manny , I wish I could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes.,,,
579,Jay ," These aren't toy airplanes, Manny. These are models, and they're very complicated. You want to fly one of these, you got to be familiar with airfoil, drag, lift, and thrust, And these are all principles of aerodynamics.",,,
580,Manny ," The box says, ""12 and up.""",,,
581,Jay , What?!,,,
582,Gloria , You can fly toy planes with J ay next time. Today you have to spend time with Luke.,,,
583,Manny , Why? ,,,
584,Gloria ," Because his mother invited you, so you go. Family needs to be close, right, Jay?",,,
585,Jay , I'm pretty sure this is a typo.,,,
586,Gloria ," Men need their hobbies. Manny's father had many hobbies, like hiking in the desert, That kind of skiing that they drop you from the... How do you say in English? The...",,,
587,Jay , Helicopter.,,,
588,Gloria ," Yes. Once, on a dare, he even boxed with an alligator.",,,
589,Jay , Wrestle. You wrestle... you can't box with alligators.,,,
590,Gloria ," Are you sure? How would they get the gloves on those lile claws? Aren't they like tiny, little hands?",,,
591,Jay ," No! Okay, now I forgot what we were talking about.",,,
592,Gloria ," Anyways, hobbies are important for the men, Whether you're risking your life or flying little planes from a safe distance.",,,
593,Mitchell ," Wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?",,,
594,Cameron , We're just gonna buy some diapers. It'll just take a second.,,,
595,Mitchell , This is Costco.,,,
596,Cameron ," Yeah, which is where we buy diapers.",,,
597,Mitchell , Since when?,,,
598,Cameron , Do you remember when we adopted that baby a few months back? Since then.,,,
599,Cameron , Mitchell is a snob.,,,
600,Mitchell ," No, n-no, I'm... I'm discerning.",,,
601,Cameron ," Official slogan for snobs. When we first met, he wouldn't even look at me because I was a hick from the farm in missouri and he's a big city mouse.",,,
602,Mitchell ," Who says ""city mouse""?",,,
603,Cameron , Country mice.,,,
604,Dylan , I think I'm gonna go wait in the car.,,,
605,Phil ," Okay. Hey, if you're on your way out, can you grab the garbage? ",,,
606,Claire , I got it.,,,
607,Phil ," Okay, we got it. He's a little jumpy.",,,
608,Claire ," Oh, go figure a teenage boy doesn't want to hang out With his girlfriend's dad.",,,
609,Phil , I thought we were past all that. I'm all about... I'm all about taking it to the next level.,,,
610,Claire , Really? I thought you were all about keeping it real.,,,
611,Phil ," Yes, but the whole point of keeping it real is so you can take it to the next level. Did you really not know that?",,,
612,Claire , You haven't exactly taken it to the next level with my dad.,,,
613,Phil , What are you talking about?,,,
614,Claire ," We've been married for 16 years, and you still walk on eggshells around him.",,,
615,Phil , What? Are you kidding? Jay and I are total buds.,,,
616,Jay , You... you want to just hang out?,,,
617,Phil ," Brought six friends, so that just... Let's... [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
618,Gloria , Manny brought his favorite game to play with Luke.,,,
619,Manny ," It's called ""empire."" You use strategy to expand territories and take over the world.",,,
620,Claire , Luke is gonna love that. He's out back playing.,,,
621,Gloria , Do you need me to get you something while I'm out shopping?,,,
622,Claire ," That's such a nice offer, but I think we're good. Thanks.",,,
623,Alex ," Okay, what about this?",,,
624,Claire , You don't even say hello to Gloria and Manny?,,,
625,Alex ," Hi, Gloria and Manny. Okay, mom, what about this?",,,
626,Claire ," No, you're wearing a dress.",,,
627,Alex ," Mom, come on!",,,
628,Claire , What? It's gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon?,,,
629,Alex ," But it's a wedding for some friend of yours, that I never even heard of. ",,,
630,Claire , It's nonnegotiable. You can borrow a dress of Haley's again.,,,
631,Alex ," No, that sends an ugly message... That I'm Haley. You know, instead of trying to force me to wear a dress, Why don't you worry about getting Luke to wear some pants?",,,
632,Claire , What? Why does he do this? Luke! Pants! Come on!,,,
633,Phil," Jay and I are buds, for sure, But with kind of an invisible asterisk. Um, he's not, uh... he's not a talker... Or... or a hugger. Once, he ran over my foot with his car. To... to be fair, he had just given up smoking. But, basically, we're buds.",,,
634,Jay , Do you have to just stand there? You're making me feel uneasy.,,,
635,Phil , Oh.,,,
636,Jay ," Oh, for god's sake, sit here. Here, hold this wing like this while I adjust this.",,,
637,Phil , Okay.,,,
638,Jay , Come on. Here. Not too hard.,,,
639,Phil , Okay.,,,
640,Gloria ," Alex, why don't you come shopping with me? Maybe I can help you find something that you like.",,,
641,Claire ," That's a really nice offer, but it's not really her thing.",,,
642,Alex ," Actually, I'd love to go. See, you don't know what my thing is. You have no idea what my thing is.",,,
643,Claire ," I know what your thing is. Your thing is to provoke, Just like your sister's thing is to never come out of her room, And your brother's thing -- Oh, well, there's your brother's thing. Luke! Put 'em on!",,,
644,Phil ," The thing about me and Jay is, our relationship's always been stuck in that primal place where it started. You know, he's the old silverback protecting his females. Then along comes this younger, stronger gorilla, swinging in, beating his chest, you know. Naturally, the ape ladies come running, presenting their  nice scarlet behinds. Papa ape wants to stop all that but he can't, you know. That's... that's life. I'm not the enemy. The enemy is poachers.",,,
645,Jay , That'll do it. Don't touch it. All right. You want to go fly it?,,,
646,Phil , Sure.,,,
647,Cameron ," Oh, hey. I got the toothpaste and the soap.",,,
648,Mitchell , Good. Now we can open that general store. I thought we were just here to get diapers.,,,
649,Cameron ," We had a saying on the farm... As long as you're bringing the mule to the market, you... I feel you rolling your eyes at me.",,,
650,Cameron , We met at one of Pepper's legendary game nights. I remember Mitchell because he kept rolling his eyes Every time I would get a little boisterous.,,,
651,Mitchell , I did not!,,,
652,Cameron , A little bit.,,,
653,Mitchell ," Yeah, maybe a little bit. We were... we were playing charades, And I-I had no idea how to act out my clue, And all I could think of to do was... And without missing a beat, Cam says...",,,
654,Cameron ," ""Casablanca.""",,,
655,Mitchell , All I did was this...,,,
656,Cameron ," ""Casablanca. Casablanca.""",,,
657,Mitchell , Can we just please get the diapers and get out of here?,,,
658,Cameron ," Fine, but I want to stop by the wine section first.",,,
659,Mitchell , Wait. There's a wine section?,,,
660,Cameron ," Yeah, a really good one... just past the tires.",,,
661,Mitchell ," No way, they do not have... Oh, my God. Oh, my... cam. Cam. The paper shredder I wanted, huh? Confetti and crosscut...",,,
662,Cameron , Yep.,,,
663,Mitchell ," Ohh! Oh, my god, amazing.",,,
664,Cameron , Yeah.,,,
665,Mitchell , Cam... What is this place? ,,,
666,Manny , Those cookies smell like heaven. Your own recipe?,,,
667,Claire ," No, I just throw them in the en.",,,
668,Manny , And added the secret ingredient of caring?,,,
669,Claire ," Sure. So, you and Luke having a good time?",,,
670,Manny , I don't know. He won't come out of his box. Maybe I'll just stay here and spend some time with my sister.,,,
671,Claire ," Oh, right, I guess, technically, I would be your stepsister.",,,
672,Manny ," My mother says we are never to use the word ""step"" because it means ""not real,"" And we are a real family.",,,
673,Claire , Mm.,,,
674,Manny ," So, what is the matter, claire?",,,
675,Claire , What?,,,
676,Manny , You seem sad.,,,
677,Claire ," It's just stuff with Alex... you know, kid stuff.",,,
678,Manny ," Ugh, kids. You don't have to tell me. My school is full of them.",,,
679,Gloria ," I was thinking, after lunch, we can go and do a little shopping.",,,
680,Alex , I'm not getting a dress.,,,
681,Gloria , I don't care. I'm not your mother.,,,
682,Alex , I know. You're my grandmother.,,,
683,Gloria ," Step-grandmother. Anyways, today, think of me as a girlfriend... Two girls out for an afternoon of fun.",,,
684,Alex , What do you usually do with your girlfriends?,,,
685,Gloria ," I don't know. We go out. We talk, drink wine.",,,
686,Alex , Can I drink wine?,,,
687,Gloria , No.,,,
688,Alex , Some friend.,,,
689,Gloria ," Well, you can still talk to me about anything.",,,
690,Alex ," Yeah, adults always say that, but they don't mean it. When my mom says I can ask her anything, I really can't. She just freaks out.",,,
691,Gloria , I won't freak out. Shoot.,,,
692,Alex , Okay. How many men have you slept with? ,,,
693,Gloria , Eight. Next.,,,
694,Phil , Now can I try it?,,,
695,Jay , No.,,,
696,Phil ," I should get one of those. I've always loved planes. You know, if things had gone a little differently in my life, I think I would have been a pilot. Hey, what would happen if you turned the remote off And then back on real fast?",,,
697,Jay ," Yeah, you would have been a great pilot.",,,
698,Phil ," So, can you do a... can you do a loop-de-loop?",,,
699,Jay , If I wanted to.,,,
700,Phil , No way!,,,
701,Phil , Can I try it?,,,
702,Jay , No.,,,
703,Phil , Okay. I can see why you like this. It's so peaceful. It's like the whole world just...Disappears out here. I remember this one summer...,,,
704,Jay , I'll tell you what.,,,
705,Phil , Hmm?,,,
706,Jay ," There's another trick called ""threading the needle."" I used to do it with Claire and Mitch when they were kids. You want to try it?",,,
707,Phil , How does it go?,,,
708,Jay ," You grab one of those hoops over there And go to the far, far, far end of the field and stand there, And I fly the plane through it.",,,
709,Phil ," Um, that sounds awesome! And then I get a chance flying it?",,,
710,Jay , No.,,,
711,Phil , Okay. How's this?,,,
712,Jay ," Not far enough. Go on. Okay, further down.",,,
713,Phil , Está bien. Más lejos.,,,
714,Jay , You can't go too far.,,,
715,Phil ," Right, okay. I get it. I get it! How's this?",,,
716,Jay , Good! Now stand still! Don't move!,,,
717,Phil , Ay! Let's do it! Whoo! Whoo! I love it! I love it! You drove the plane into my face.,,,
718,Jay , You must have moved. I told you to stay still. ,,,
719,Phil , I didn't move!,,,
720,Jay , Try not to talk. I want to make sure nothing's broken.,,,
721,Claire ," Alex and I can't just disagree. I mean, she has to turn everything into a fight.",,,
722,Manny ," Hmm, a strong, independent woman. Sounds like somebody else I know.",,,
723,Claire ," I was never hostile, thou. This... this whole thing with the dress -- Never had this problem with Haley.",,,
724,Manny , Maybe Alex doesn't want to compete with her big sister. Maybe she's trying to create her own identity. Put her in a dress and she disappears for one afternoon. I wouldn't give up being myself for even one second.,,,
725,Claire , Wow. Sometimes it's hard to remember you're only 10 years old.,,,
726,Manny , And three-quarters.,,,
727,Claire , Yeah. Hello? Olives? Yeah.,,,
728,Mitchell , You got it.,,,
729,Cameron ," Mitchell, I found the diapers. They're over here.",,,
730,Mitchell ," Cameron, guess what I found. Coffins. They sell baby formula, and they sell coffins. You can literally buy everything you need From birth to death. Oh, my god, look at these diapers. Look how cheap they are! Oh, you know what we should do? We should get enough for like the next year or two, right?",,,
731,Cameron , Where would we keep them?,,,
732,Mitchell , They sell sheds.,,,
733,Cameron , Really? You want to buy a diaper shed. We're those guys now? The guys with the diaper shed?,,,
734,Mitchell , Just grab two more.,,,
735,Cameron ," I'm not grabbing two more, Mitchell. It's time to go.",,,
736,Mitchell ," No, come on, come on. We need a... Excuse me. Where did you get that flatbed thing?",,,
737,Woman , Over there.,,,
738,Mitchell , Go grab one of those.,,,
739,Cameron , Really? ,,,
740,Mitchell , Yeah. Get two. I'm in the applesauce aisle!,,,
741,Mitchell ," So, anyways, after charades, we went out for coffee, and I learned that he loves art, He plays the piano, he speaks french.",,,
742,Cameron , Un peu.,,,
743,Mitchell ," So, you know, I-I misjudged him.",,,
744,Cameron ," Yeah, I'm sort of like Costco. I'm big, I'm not fancy, and I dare you to not like me.",,,
745,Mitchell ," Yeah, and I'm kind of more like that, um... Oh. What is the name of that little shop we went to in paris?",,,
746,Cameron ," You are such a snob. ""casablanca.""",,,
747,Gloria ," I have a small flower on my ankle and a tiny, little butterfly on my... Thigh.",,,
748,Alex , How high up?,,,
749,Gloria , Very high.,,,
750,Alex , Did you do it to look sexy?,,,
751,Gloria , No.,,,
752,Alex , Did you do it for a guy? Does grandpa like it?,,,
753,Gloria ," No, no, and yes.",,,
754,Alex , That's gross. Mm. Let's go back to your piercings.,,,
755,Gloria ," No, no, no. I've answered enough of your questions. Now it's your turn to answer one.",,,
756,Alex , What is it?,,,
757,Gloria , Why you don't want to wear a dress?,,,
758,Alex , Because I don't want to look like Haley and her stupid friends.,,,
759,Gloria ," I wear dresses, and I don't look like Haley.",,,
760,Alex ," You are Haley, just...40 years older.",,,
761,Gloria , 10.,,,
762,Alex , 20.,,,
763,Gloria ," Deal. Alex, why are you fighting me on this?",,,
764,Alex , It doesn't matter if I dress up. I'm not pretty like Haley and you.,,,
765,Gloria , That's ridiculous! You're beautiful!,,,
766,Alex , I'm not. But that's okay. I'm the smart one. ,,,
767,Gloria ," Hmm, the cute busboy doesn't know that you're smart.",,,
768,Alex , What?,,,
769,Gloria , He's been smiling at you every time he comes to the table.,,,
770,Alex , He does not!,,,
771,Gloria ," Why do you think we are the only people with bread? Look, one day, you are going to want to date a cute guy like that. When that day comes, you're gonna want to look beautiful, And then you'll wear a dress.",,,
772,Alex ," So, you ever kiss another girl?",,,
773,Gloria , That's no way to talk to your grandmother.,,,
774,Claire ," Was my mom hard on me growing up? Yeah, she was, but you know what? Back then, everything was Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. They didn't understand...",,,
775,Gloria , Hola. We're back.,,,
776,Alex , Hello.,,,
777,Claire ," Hey, how'd it go?",,,
778,Gloria , It was great. Did you have fun with Luke?,,,
779,Manny ," Well, not...",,,
780,Claire ," They had a great time. Alex, I've been thinking, and... if you don't want to wear a dress to the wedding, it's not the end of the world.",,,
781,Alex , It's all right. I bought one.,,,
782,Claire , Do you see how she has to provoke me?,,,
783,Manny , We'll talk about it next week.,,,
784,Jay , Clear the way. Coming through. Coming through.,,,
785,Phil , Ow! Ow! I need to rest my face.,,,
786,Jay , You're fine. You'll be all right.,,,
787,Claire ," Oh, my god!",,,
788,Alex , Dad!,,,
789,Jay , Little accident. Nothing big.,,,
790,Phil , I was in a plane crash.,,,
791,Claire , What happened?,,,
792,Jay ," We were threading the needle, and somebody moved.",,,
793,Phil ," No, I didn't. You did it on purpose.",,,
794,Jay , That's the painkiller talking. He's a little loopy. ,,,
795,Gloria , How bad is it?,,,
796,Jay ," Well, the wing is cracked, the propeller's bent, But I can...",,,
797,Gloria , I mean Phil.,,,
798,Phil , I was in a plane crash.,,,
799,Alex ," Thanks, dad.",,,
800,Jay , I didn't ask him to be there. He insisted. He took a chance. This is what happened.,,,
801,Claire , Kind of like the time you ran over his foot?,,,
802,Gloria , You ran over his foot?,,,
803,Jay , That was an accident.,,,
804,Claire ," You know, dad, you did it on purpose. We all saw the tire marks on the lawn.",,,
805,Jay ," I had just quit smoking. See, you're upsetting your husband.",,,
806,Phil , Water.,,,
807,Claire , I'll get it.,,,
808,Gloria , You okay?,,,
809,Phil , Gloria. Thank god you're here.,,,
810,Manny ," Don't worry. I'm here, too.",,,
811,Phil , Who's this?,,,
812,Jay , Wasn't my fault.,,,
813,Claire ," Oh, I have seen you thread the needle a million times. You never miss.",,,
814,Jay ," Yeah, I must be getting old.",,,
815,Claire , Why don't you just admit it? You never liked Phil. And put that down. You do not get a cookie.,,,
816,Jay ," I like Phil. It's just that sometimes he tries too hard, you know? And it's just kind of... irritating.",,,
817,Claire ," Okay, maybe he tries too hard, because you make zero effort with him. You know what? In the 16 years that we've been married, have you one time told him that you liked him?",,,
818,Jay ," Not in those exact words, no.",,,
819,Claire ," No, not in any words, dad. How do you think that makes me feel?",,,
820,Gloria , You've never told your son that you love him? ,,,
821,Jay ," Whoa, whoa, when did we jump to ""love""? And he's technically not my son.",,,
822,Gloria ," Ah. So that means that you don't love Manny, either?",,,
823,Jay ," Well, sure I do. I mean, believe me, when I was in that park, I really wished Manny was there.",,,
824,Gloria , For what? So that you could fly the plane into his head? Huh?,,,
825,Claire ," Dad, thanks so much for bringing Phil home. I found one of your little flaps in his hair, so...",,,
826,Jay ," Actually, this is called an aileron. It controls the...",,,
827,Claire ," Yeah, 'cause that's what matters right now. Bye, dad.",,,
828,Jay ," Hey, Phil.",,,
829,Phil , Jay. Ow!,,,
830,Jay ," What, are you made of china? Phil, I just want you to know, I'm sorry. And whether I missed or you moved...",,,
831,Phil , I didn't.,,,
832,Jay , Either way... I just want to say that I like you.,,,
833,Phil , Really?,,,
834,Jay , Yeah.,,,
835,Phil , What do you like about me?,,,
836,Jay , You're a nice guy. You try real hard.,,,
837,Phil , I do. You're a good dad.,,,
838,Jay , I am a good dad.,,,
839,Phil ," Come here. Come here, you. This feels so right.",,,
840,Mitchell , What's going on?,,,
841,Gloria ," There was a little accident, But Jay's telling Phil how much he loves him.",,,
842,Cameron ," Oh, well, that's nice for Phil.",,,
843,Mitchell ," That's great, since he's never said anything like that to my boyfriend.",,,
844,Cameron , Let it go.,,,
845,Mitchell ," No, it's not okay.",,,
846,Gloria ," Mitch is right. You go in there, too, cam. Come on.",,,
847,Jay , You're kidding.,,,
848,Gloria , Jay!,,,
849,Jay ," Come on in, Cam. ",,,
850,Cameron , A little hug?,,,
851,Jay , Get in here.,,,
852,Gloria ," Say it, say it!",,,
853,Jay ," I like you, too, Cam.",,,
854,Phil , What do you like about him?,,,
855,Jay ," Oh, geez.",,,
856,Gloria , Where did you get that camera?,,,
857,Mitchell , Only the greatest store on earth.,,,
858,Claire ," Thanks, dad.",,,
859,Gloria ," Manny, picture. Get in there, too.",,,
860,Phil ," Get in here, Manny.",,,
861,Gloria ," Stay still, say, ""cheese!""",,,
862,Jay , Don't push it.,,,
863,Together , Cheese!,,,
864,Gloria , Picture!,,,
865,Together , Cheese! Cheese! Queso!,,,
866,Cameron , How beautiful!,,,
867,Jay ," Oh, boy!",,,
868,Phil , Doesn't it feel like his arms could go around the world?,,,
869,Cameron , I think I strained something.,,,
870,Gloria ," I always wanted a daughter. To dress her up with pretty dresses... Do her hair, her nails, her makeup. No one knows this, but for the first year of his life, I made up Manny like a girl and told everybody that he was my daughter. But just for a few times. I didn't want to mess with his head. When he found the pictures, I told him that it was his twin sister who died, you know.   Modern Family",,,
871,Gloria ," Jay, I’m home. Did Manny call?",,,
872,Jay ," No, because he's fine. He's at a slumber party, not a gang fight.",,,
873,Gloria , I just want him to fit in. I'm gonna take a shower. Do you care to join me?,,,
874,Jay ," You know, honey, there's a gun in the footlocker in the garage. If I ever say ""no"" to that question, I want you to use it on me.",,,
875,Claire ," Shh, shh, shh!",,,
876,Phil , What's wrong? Why aren't they trying to hurt each other?,,,
877,Claire ," I don't know, but I'm afraid to move.",,,
878,Haley , You're really good at this.,,,
879,Luke , Thanks.,,,
880,Phil ," What is happening, Claire?",,,
881,Cameron , Mmm.,,,
882,Mitchell , What do you think?,,,
883,Cameron ," Now, that is a scone.",,,
884,Mitchell ," No butter, nonfat.",,,
885,Cameron , Shut up. I'm gonna go check on Lily.,,,
886,Dede , Surprise!,,,
887,Mitchell , Mom!,,,
888,Gloria , What's that?,,,
889,Jay , Sounds like a bird hit the window.,,,
890,Gloria ," Oh, god, that's a bad sign.",,,
891,Haley ," Ow! That hurt, jerk!",,,
892,Luke ," Ow! I'm gonna kill you, stupid!",,,
893,Haley , Ow!,,,
894,Claire , What happened?,,,
895,Phil , Now I'm sad.,,,
896,Haley , Uhh! ,,,
897,Dede ," Hi, honey.",,,
898,Mitchell , Hi. I-I didn't know you were in town. You didn't call.,,,
899,Dede ," Well, I couldn't wait to see your new baby. Where is she?",,,
900,Cameron," Mitchell, who was that?",,,
901,Mitchell ," Uh, it's my mom.",,,
902,Cameron ," Oh, yeah, right. 'cause the last time she was here, the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves into a penta... Grandma! [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
903,Mitchell ," Mom...Mom, what are you doing to her legs?",,,
904,Dede ," Tai chi. I did it every day in Sedona. Cameron, you should try it.",,,
905,Cameron ," Mitchell's mother has a problem...With me. Last Christmas, for example, she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer. So, to recap, I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings, and she gave me a hint.",,,
906,Dede ," And living in Sedona has been transformational. I get up every morning, and I go to a vortex meditation site and work with a shaman to finally understand how to live my spirituality.",,,
907,Mitchell , Yikes.,,,
908,Dede , And I've learned that the only way I can move to the next level of my awakening is if we all can somehow get past... the incident.,,,
909,Mitchell , The incident.,,,
910,Cameron ," Oh, boy.",,,
911,Dede , I would like to congratulate Jay and the lovely Gloria. I'm very happy for them.  ,,,
912,Gloria ," I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay because my ex-husband and I got married in a tiny, little office of a judge in Colombia.",,,
913,Mitchell ," Well, my mother wanted to go to the wedding to show everyone how okay she was with all of it, So I convinced dad and Gloria to invite her.",,,
914,Cameron , Who warned you that that was the worst idea ever? Anyone? Anyone? Oh.,,,
915,Dede ," Of course, I've... I've moved on. I was supposed to come with a date, But he just hurt his back, Which is very ironic because he's young and... and healthy.",,,
916,Claire ," My mom started drinking these cocktails called ""horny Colombians"" with some of Gloria's uncles, whom, apparently, the drink was named after.",,,
917,Phil ," Oh, come on, they were funny.",,,
918,Claire , They kept patting my butt.,,,
919,Phil ," somebody's full of herself. It's a... it's a Colombian wedding tradition, they said.",,,
920,Dede , I would like to make a toast.,,,
921,Haley ," Yeah, Nana got totally wasted. Uh, it was really funny. Then it was gross.",,,
922,Dede ," To the bride and the groom, my ex. 35 years we were together, And he couldn't wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo. I'm kidding. Seriously, I knew they were perfect for each other when I saw his wallet and her boobs. Take your hands off me.",,,
923,Mitchell , Mom. Mom.,,,
924,Dede ," Oh, relax, Mitchell. What did you take your Claire pill?",,,
925,Mitchell ," Okay, l-let's just... let's get a little fresh air, okay? Come on.",,,
926,Cameron , And then it got weird. ,,,
927,Dede ," I'm Gloria. I'm Gloria. Kiss me. Oh, hey, kiss me.",,,
928,Luke , Nana is really strong.,,,
929,Dede , Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi! Ooh! Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!,,,
930,Gloria ," During my vows to my first husband, drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge. This was way worse.",,,
931,Jay ," What can I say? I drive women crazy. It's too soon, I guess.",,,
932,Haley ," Everybody is going to be there, mom.",,,
933,Claire ," I don't care. Your father and I are not about to let you drive two hours to go to a concert and then spend the night with a bunch of boys, especially that 17-year-old hormone you're dating.",,,
934,Haley , It's totally supervised.,,,
935,Claire ," Oh, really? By whom?",,,
936,Haley , By Spencer Patine's uncle.,,,
937,Claire , Who's Spencer Patine?,,,
938,Haley , You know Spencer... the guy with the arm.,,,
939,Phil , Wait. What kind of arm? What does that even mean?,,,
940,Haley , His uncle is uncle Tobey.,,,
941,Claire ," Oh, uncle Tobey. I'll be sure to include that in my amber alert.",,,
942,Haley ," Oh, my god.",,,
943,Phil ," Okay can I step in here? I think I can help. Haley, what your mom is worried about is you getting your heart broken when Dylan goes off to college next year.",,,
944,Haley , He's not going to college.,,,
945,Claire , That's not what I'm even think... He's not going to college?,,,
946,Haley ," He's in a band, okay? They're going on tour.",,,
947,Claire ," Oh, this just gets better and better.",,,
948,Haley , Why are you always on me about everything?!,,,
949,Claire , Because you need to understand...,,,
950,Phil ," okay, now, everybody, calm down. Let's start from the beginning. What's wrong with Spencer's arm? ",,,
951,Haley , Ugh!,,,
952,Manny ," Mom, I'm home!",,,
953,Gloria ," Hi, baby! Did you have fun at the slumber party? You must be exhausted.",,,
954,Manny ," No, I'm not tired at all. I was the first one to fall asleep.",,,
955,Gloria , What's on your face?,,,
956,Manny , A smile from having such a good time with my friends.,,,
957,Gloria , No. Come here. Look.,,,
958,Manny , Oh. That's why they were laughing. I thought it was my funny take on current events.,,,
959,Gloria , Why would they do something like that?,,,
960,Jay , Don't worry about it. Guys pull pranks like that all the time. You just got to prank 'em back. Just got to show 'em you're willing to give as good as you get.,,,
961,Gloria ," What do you think? Hmm, revenge... I like it.",,,
962,Mitchell ," Well, mom, instead of scratching it down a wall, Maybe we should just try and repress it like a... like a normal family.",,,
963,Dede , I can't. I need closure. I'm about to embark on a new journey. I met a man.,,,
964,Mitchell , Really?,,,
965,Dede ," His name is Chas, And he's asked me to come live with him in his foreign land.",,,
966,Mitchell , Wow. Where?,,,

1054,Claire ," Oh, you know, mom makes a mess, and there's Mitchell to clean it up.",,,

1078,Mitchell , No. Why does everybody keep say... no. I... I'm just trying to piece this family back together. So you'll talk to Gloria about mom coming to dinner?,,,
1079,Jay ," Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years. She's still furious with your mother, which is why I'm not talking to you.",,,
1080,Mitchell , What did I do?,,,
1081,Jay , This conversation never took place.,,,
1082,Mitchell ," Well, that's not very nice. I drove all the way here.",,,
1083,Jay ," No, you didn't. You were never here. In fact, you never even called.",,,
1084,Mitchell ," I would have called, but I thought it would be better to talk about th... what... what's happening here?",,,
1085,Jay ," Listen... I would love to get this thing behind us, but Gloria would never forgive me if I pulled a fast one on her. That's why you're going to pull a fast one on her, and I'm not going to like it one bit. ",,,
1086,Mitchell ," Okay, that's just great. No, that's great. So it's all up to me.",,,

1093,Dede , He has a very gentle soul.,,,
1094,Claire ," You got that from ""hey""?",,,
1095,Phil ," So, Dylan, I see you brought the ax.",,,
1096,Dylan ," Yeah, yeah, I just came from practice. Sweet. Miss those days.",,,
1097,Dylan ," Oh, you were in a band?",,,

1100,Claire ," Oh, that's gonna be dad and Gloria.",,,
1101,Dede ," Oh, Mitchell, I know it's silly, but... I'm a little nervous.",,,
1102,Mitchell ," Oh, no. That's not silly. You should be.",,,
1103,Phil , Hey. How are you? Manny.,,,
1104,Manny , Phil.,,,
1105,Phil , Nice mustache.,,,

1110,Dede ," Hi, Jay. Gloria.",,,
1111,Gloria , What is she doing here?,,,
1112,Dede ," What does she mean, ""what is she doing here?"" Mitchell told you I'd be here.",,,
1113,Gloria , Lies!,,,
1114,Mitchell ," I couldn't tell her because she wouldn't come. Gloria, my mom wants to apologize for everything. ",,,
1115,Jay ," So you just spring it on Gloria like this? Mitchell, what the hell is wrong with you?",,,
1116,Gloria , I don't want her apologies.,,,
1117,Jay ," And who could blame you, honey? Which is why this is a terrible idea by you!",,,
1118,Gloria ," Jay, Manny, let's go.",,,
1119,Dede ," Oh, wait, wait, Gloria. I d... I just want to tell you how sorry I am for ruining your wedding. I was struggling with being alone. Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily. And... and not with just anyone... with a... young and smart and beautiful woman I don't expect to forgive me. If I were you, I'd want to punch me right in the mouth.",,,
1120,Gloria , I think we've had enough revenge in this family for one day.,,,
1121,Mitchell ," Oh, okay. Y-y-you see? Yeah, we're all gonna move past this. And because of me, who... who's not a mama's boy. But is a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight, So make a note, bitches.",,,
1122,Cameron , That's not a good color on you.,,,
1123,Gloria , I forgive you.,,,
1124,Dede , Oh. Wow. I am not prepared for this. I just... I wa... I want to rip your head off!,,,
1125,Gloria , You ruined my wedding!,,,
1126,Phil , I got Gloria! I got Gloria! I got Gloria.,,,
1127,Mitchell , Stand up like a big girl. Come on.,,,
1128,Jay ," All right, all right, all right. Stop it, stop it, stop it, the two of you!",,,
1129,Haley , I am so sorry about this.,,,
1130,Dylan ," No, it's cool. It's cool.",,,
1131,Jay ," This is ridiculous. Gloria didn't steal me, Dede, and you know it. We grew apart for years. And you left to find yourself, remember?",,,
1132,Dede , I thought I could handle this. I'm so sorry.,,,
1133,Gloria ," You don't say ""sorry"" anymore! That word means nothing in your mouth!",,,
1134,Phil , I got Gloria. ,,,
1135,Haley , I don't know what just happened.,,,
1136,Dylan ," I do. I mean, it seems pretty simple to me. You're reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome. Um, maybe... maybe you shouldn't... Look, look, look, I'm used to this, The whole bigfamily thing. In my house, we don't even talk to each other. You know, it's funny, the first time I saw Haley, I knew I liked her. I mean, she's beautiful and everything, But it's... it's not just that. It's that she's got this killer confidence... You know, the kind of confidence that you get from having a family like this, that's passionate and accepting of hot foreigners and gay dudes and nutty people... You know, a family that actually loves each other.",,,
1137,Claire ," I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but maybe we should let her go with him.",,,
1138,Phil , He's perfect.,,,
1139,Claire ," Everybody, Haley says that Dylan is a musician, and he writes some great songs.",,,
1140,Phil ," Play something, bro.",,,
1141,Dylan ," Well, I guess so, if you want me to.",,,
1142,Phil , We could all use a nice tune right now.,,,
1143,Dylan ," This is actually a song I wrote for Haley. It's called ""in the moonlight.""",,,
1144,Cameron ," Lovely title, Dylan.",,,
1145,Dylan ," Thanks. *The stars are falling from the sky and you're the reason why the moon is shining on your face 'cause it finally feels it's found its place 'cause, baby, baby, I just want to do you do you do you want to do me do me underneath the moonlight the moonlight? baby, baby, maybe I will steal you steal you just so I can feel you  feel you maybe that would heal you heal you on the inside*",,,

1152,Jay ," …baby, you can do me do me man, I will do you do you…",,,
1153,Cameron , …maybe that would heal you from the inside…,,,
1154,Mitchell , …from the inside…,,,
1155,Mitchell & Cameron ," …from the inside, from the inside.",,,
1156,Cameron , Never good at harmonizing.,,,
1157,Mitchell , That was good.   Modern Family,,,
1158,Jay ," Let's go, buddy. School time. Gloria, if you want to get together with the girls later, I could just watch the football game or something.",,,
1159,Manny , That means he wants to watch the football game.,,,
1160,Jay ," I'm not talking to you. And what are you drinking coffee for, anyway?",,,
1161,Manny , It's my culture. I'm Colombian.,,,
1162,Jay , Oh yeah? What part of Colombia are those French toaster sticks from?,,,
1163,Gloria , I'm not sure about the game. The whole family is coming over for the barbecue.,,,
1164,Jay , It's today?,,,
1165,Manny , Sí.,,,
1166,Jay , It's the Ohio State game.,,,
1167,Gloria , So? Everybody can watch.,,,
1168,Jay , I don't like watching the game with people who don't know the game. People talk.,,,
1169,Manny , You talk at my football games.,,,
1170,Jay ," For one thing, it's called soccer. Your team's scored two goals all season. I'm not taking a big risk. How much of this did you drink?",,,
1171,Manny , Give me a break. I have to climb a rope today.,,,
1172,Haley ," Hey, mom?",,,

1177,Claire , What book?,,,
1178,Haley , I want a dress.,,,
1179,Claire , Do you have any idea what a bad liar you are?,,,
1180,Alex , I'd be more worried that she couldn't come up with a single book title.,,,
1181,Phil ," Luke, come on, we're late! ",,,
1182,Claire , There's a first... Inside out and backwards. At least it isn't zipped into his... There it is.,,,
1183,Phil ," Well... there's book smart, and then there's street smart.",,,
1184,Claire ," Yeah, and then there's Luke.",,,
1185,Phil ," He's just curious, that's all. He's got this almost scientific mind with a thirst for knowledge. He's like this little Einstein. Some people ask ""why?"" Luke asks, ""why not?""",,,
1186,Claire ," I ask ""why"" a lot.",,,
1187,Cameron ," We're at the 10... We're at the 5... We're at the 1... Daddy, we're scoring a touchdown!",,,
1188,Mitchell , Please don't spike our baby. Why does she look like the Hamburger?,,,
1189,Cameron , She's a referee.,,,
1190,Mitchell , Do we even have to go to my dad's tonight?,,,
1191,Cameron , Are you kidding me? We're playing Ohio State.,,,
1192,Cameron ," I collect antique fountain pens, I'm adept at Japanese flower arrangement... Ikebana. And I was a starting offensive lineman at the University of Illinois. Surprise!",,,
1193,Mitchell , I don't like football.,,,
1194,Cameron , Being in a relationship is pretending to enjoy your partner's interests. Do you think I really loved home pickle making?,,,
1195,Mitchell ," Yeah, 'cause you did.",,,
1196,Cameron ," For a week, until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles. ""Oh, thank you, Marvin, for inviting us into your lovely home. Care for a sack of pickles?""",,,
1197,Mitchell , It was charming.,,,
1198,Cameron ," We were picklers. You know what? Fine. Stay home with your little jagged scissors, maybe catch up on your scrapbooking.",,,
1199,Mitchell , You loved scrapbooking!,,,
1200,Cameron ," Did I, Mitchell? Did I? ",,,
1201,Mitchell ," Don't do the ""double question to prove a point"" thing. I hate it.",,,
1202,Cameron ," Do you, Mitchell? Do you? [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
1203,Claire , No problem. We'll be right down. Thanks.,,,
1204,Phil ," Hey, honey. What's up?",,,
1205,Claire , The school just called. Luke got in a fight.,,,
1206,Phil ," Oh, geez. Is he okay?",,,
1207,Claire ," Yeah, he's fine, but they want us to come down there. Where are you?",,,
1208,Phil , I'm showing a house.,,,
1209,Claire , What house?,,,
1210,Phil , I'm golfing.,,,
1211,Claire , I bet it was that Durkas kid.,,,
1212,Phil , I hate that kid.,,,
1213,Claire ," He probably jumped on Luke, and Luke just fought back. Kid's a menace.",,,
1214,Phil , He made fun of my hair once.,,,
1215,Claire ," Shh, the parents are probably in there.",,,
1216,Phil , I slept on it funny... Like that never happened to him.,,,
1217,Claire , Come on. What are you doing here?,,,
1218,Jay , These two knuckleheads were fighting.,,,
1219,Claire , What?!,,,
1220,Jay , Could have been worse.,,,
1221,Phil , I was not ready to face Durkas today.,,,
1222,Claire ," So, what happened?",,,
1223,School director ," Apparently, there was some name-calling and shoving on the playground. By the time a teacher separated them, Luke was sitting on Manny's chest.",,,
1224,Jay ," Luke, that's not like you.",,,
1225,School director , Wait a minute. You're Luke's father?,,,
1226,Jay , Grandfather.,,,
1227,School director , So Manny's father is... ,,,
1228,Gloria , Javier. Crazy guy. That's where he gets his fire.,,,
1229,School director ," Okay, you're...",,,
1230,Claire , He's our son.,,,
1231,Jay , And my grandson.,,,
1232,Claire , I'm his daughter.,,,
1233,School director ," So, you're...",,,
1234,Manny , His uncle.,,,
1235,Luke ," Stop saying that, or I'll sit on your chest again!",,,
1236,Claire , Oh! Wait a second. is that what this was all about?,,,
1237,Luke , He keeps calling me his nephew.,,,
1238,Manny , You are!,,,
1239,Luke , Shut up!,,,
1240,School director ," Okay! Okay! I'm getting the sense that you're all related... somehow. It's best if you work this out at home so the boys can go back to class, okay? But we're not happy about this, boys. This is not how mature young men behave. Here's your note for Miss Passwater. I wouldn't worry. They're good kids. It's just tough when one kid's a little different.",,,
1241,Claire ," You heard how she said that, right? She thought Luke was the weird one, Luke!",,,
1242,Gloria ," Her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture, and Manny is the different one.",,,
1243,Claire , I will tell you what's weird. Our son is not weird. What's weird is that her kid wears aftershave and dresses like a count.,,,
1244,Gloria , think We should cancel with them for the barbecue.,,,
1245,Phil ," If we cancel, it'll just make this a bigger deal than it is. It'll be good for Luke and Manny to spend some time. Might be good for you and Gloria, too.",,,
1246,Claire , Why?,,,
1247,Gloria , She's always had a problem with me. I think I'm gonna find out what it is. ,,,
1248,Jay , That's the worst thing you could do. Just sweep it under the rug.,,,
1249,Gloria , I'm not a sweeper.,,,
1250,Jay , Trust me on this.,,,
1251,Phil , I think you two need to talk it out.,,,
1252,Claire ," I don't have anything to say to her. She's the one with the problem, not me.",,,
1253,Gloria , Whose side are you on?,,,
1254,Jay , She's my daughter. You're my wife. Let's remember what's important here... There's a football game on.,,,
1255,Phil , I just hate it when my two girls aren't getting along.,,,
1256,Claire , How exactly is she your girl?,,,
1257,Cameron , I got a few things for the party. Is Lily ready to go?,,,
1258,Mitchell ," Yeah, she's ready.",,,
1259,Cameron , What's wrong?,,,
1260,Mitchell ," I'm just really worried about CJ Hightower, with the bad ankle. I don't know how he's gonna run his corner routes.",,,
1261,Cameron , What did my boyfriend just say?,,,
1262,Jay ," Listen, I heard what you said, and I thought, yes, I should try to learn more about football.",,,
1263,Cameron , That is very mature of you.,,,
1264,Mitchell ," I figure if football fans can learn it, how hard can it be?",,,
1265,Cameron , That's very elitist of you.,,,
1266,Mitchell ," I'm taking baby steps here, all right? I'm actually looking forward to it. 'Cause it's not just the game. It's the bands and the drama and the... the pageantry...",,,
1267,Cameron , Don't forget about the team mascots.,,,
1268,Mitchell , They wear ascots?,,,
1269,Cameron ," No, ""mascots,"" with an ""m."" That could have been very embarrassing. Okay, am I straight?",,,
1270,Mitchell , I am not sure what you are right now. ,,,
1271,Jay ," Hi! Hi! Hi! How you doing? Hi, beautiful.",,,
1272,Phil , Good to see you.,,,
1273,Claire , Let me guess. Game's on?,,,
1274,Jay , Just started.,,,
1275,Phil ," For you. It's nice to see you, Gloria.",,,
1276,Gloria , Two times today.,,,
1277,Claire ,Phil ! She means we've seen them two times today.,,,
1278,Jay ," Everybody, the food's in there, the drinks are in there, I'll be in here.",,,
1279,Phil ," Hold on, Jay. I think we should address the elephant in the room. Luke, Manny. Bring it in. Come on. Huddle up. Football. Now, in light of what happened at school today, if you have any feelings you'd like to express, this is the proper forum.",,,
1280,Jay ," For God's sake. All right, both of you. Now, in this family, do we kick and punch each other, or do we love each other?",,,
1281,Manny & Luke , Love each other.,,,
1282,Jay , That's right. I'll be in the den.,,,
1283,Claire ," So, I brought dessert.",,,
1284,Gloria ," Okay, thank you. I make pie, too.",,,
1285,Claire ," You can never have too many pies, right?",,,
1286,Phil ," Okay, wow! Everybody, take a deep breath. Let's think about getting real.",,,
1287,Claire ," Phil, no.",,,
1288,Gloria ," Why ""Phil, no""? What is Phil doing?",,,
1289,Phil , I'm just gonna say it... There's tension between you two. Bam! It's out there.,,,
1290,Claire , I'm gonna kill you.,,,
1291,Gloria , I think he's right. And I think we should talk about it.,,,
1292,Phil , That's what I'm talkin' 'bout... You two talking... 'bout it.,,,
1293,Alex ," I like football. Haley hates it. Which is weird because it's all boys, and there's no reading required. Do you know that she spends at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair? And then, sometimes, she...",,,
1294,Cameron ," Let's go, Illini!",,,
1295,Mitchell ," Let's go, right now! ",,,
1296,Jay ," Oh, looks like I got to watch the game with Dick Butkiss.",,,
1297,Mitchell ," Dad! Come on, that's offensive.",,,
1298,Cameron ," He's one of the greatest linebackers to ever play at Illinois, and one of my personal heroes.",,,
1299,Mitchell ," And his name is ""Butkiss""? Really, and we're just choosing to... Okay. All right. I thought you were being homophobic. Sorry.",,,
1300,Jay , We got all night.,,,
1301,Mitchell ," Yes, we do.",,,
1302,Jay , Are you joining us here?,,,
1303,Cameron ," Jay, you know what? He's been studying up.",,,
1304,Mitchell ," I got to tell you, I am a little worried about CJ Hightower, with the bad ankle. I'm wondering how he's gonna run his corner routes.",,,
1305,Jay , Hightower's out.,,,
1306,Mitchell , What? Oh... then who is gonna run the corner routes?,,,
1307,Jay , I'll tell you who won't be. Billings.,,,
1308,Cameron , That's low. He's in jail.,,,
1309,Mitchell ," Oh... wow, yeah, I didn't know.",,,
1310,Cameron , Oh! Double tight end. It's gonna be a quarterback rollout...,,,
1311,Jay , They're gonna run it.,,,
1312,Cameron ," No trust me, he's got the slot, and the end zone! Touchdown!",,,
1313,Jay , Lucky call!,,,
1314,Mitchell , They should have considered blitzing.,,,
1315,Jay , Blitzing wouldn't have helped them. Get out of here.,,,
1316,Cameron ," Oh, gosh. Blitzing.",,,
1317,Mitchell ," So, my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically as the climax of ""West Side Story."" I'm a musicaltheater fan.",,,
1318,Cameron , Surprise!,,,
1319,Gloria ," Okay, the truth? I sometimes feel like you don't like me. ",,,
1320,Phil ," Powerful, powerful stuff. Claire, tell us how it makes you feel.",,,
1321,Claire ," Right now, I'm feeling a lot of anger.",,,
1322,Phil ," Don't tell me, tell her.",,,
1323,Claire ," Gloria, I'm really angry at Phil.",,,
1324,Phil , Let's respect the process.,,,
1325,Claire ," Gloria, I don't know why you think I don't like you.",,,
1326,Gloria ," Well, sometimes when you see me, you make that face...",,,
1327,Claire , What face?,,,
1328,Gloria , Like this.,,,
1329,Claire , I do not make a face like that.,,,
1330,Mitchell ," Oh my God, that is so Claire.",,,
1331,Phil , See? She does that with everyone. It's just her face.,,,
1332,Gloria ," No, it's not just the face. From the beginning, I feel like Manny and I are not welcome in this family.",,,
1333,Claire , That is so crazy!,,,
1334,Gloria ," No, it's not so crazy. It's how I feel.",,,
1335,Claire ," I am sorry if you feel that way. I really am. Because from the moment I met you, I have tried to make you feel comfortable with us.",,,
1336,Gloria , You think it's all in my head?,,,
1337,Claire , Kind... I don't know. I mean... We really love having you and Manny in our family.,,,
1338,Gloria , Really?,,,
1339,Claire , Really. So... you don't have to be so defensive.,,,
1340,Gloria ," I do that, don't I?",,,
1341,Claire , A little. A little bit.,,,
1342,Phil ," I'm feeling a hug. I was thinking group hug, but this is nice.",,,
1343,Haley ," I'd be there if I could... Oh, my God, there's hugging.",,,
1344,Claire ," Haley, get off the phone already.",,,
1345,Cameron , Where did you go?,,,
1346,Mitchell ," You heard him. He said, ""get out of here.""",,,
1347,Jay ," Oh my god, you're such a girl!",,,
1348,Mitchell ," Dad, loo... I was coming to get a beer, anyways. Nice apology.",,,
1349,Jay , Nice beer. ,,,
1350,Phil ," There's our little roustabouts! You look like you patched things up pretty good, huh? We can learn so much from the children. I bet it seems kind of silly now what you were fighting about.",,,
1351,Luke , I made fun of his accent.,,,
1352,Gloria , What accent?,,,
1353,Manny , I made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day.,,,
1354,Luke , I made fun of him because his mom used to dig coal.,,,
1355,Gloria , What?,,,
1356,Manny , He said you were a coal digger.,,,
1357,Phil ," Okay, I think we can move on!",,,
1358,Gloria , Who said I was a coal digger?,,,
1359,Luke , That's what my mom told me.,,,
1360,Alex , What's a coal digger?,,,
1361,Phil ," Sweaty, He heard it wrong. It's ""gold digger.""",,,
1362,Haley , I'm gonna have to call you back.,,,
1363,Claire , I really do not think that I remember ever saying that.,,,
1364,Luke ," Well, you said it in the car, you said it at Christmas, you said it in the Mexican restaurant...",,,
1365,Claire ," Okay, Mr. ""Leaves his sweatshirts at school every day"" suddenly remembers everything. Thank you.",,,
1366,Gloria ," And it was all in my head, huh?",,,
1367,Claire ," Listen, Gloria, it was like a year ago before... I knew you...",,,
1368,Manny , Nice going. Now my mom and my sister are fighting.,,,
1369,Claire ," If I say something everybody's thinking, does that make me a mean person? Or... does it make me a brave person? One who is courageous enough to stand up and say something... Behind someone's back to... a 10-year old?",,,
1370,Jay ," Well, she's pissed.",,,
1371,Claire ," Yeah, she wouldn't even come out of her room.",,,
1372,Jay , Did you really have to call her that? A gold digger. ,,,
1373,Claire ," You know what, dad? It was a year ago. And it was a natural question to ask. She's a beautiful, hot woman, and you're not exactly... You know.",,,
1374,Jay , Not exactly what?,,,
1375,Claire ," Mitchell, a little help?",,,
1376,Mitchell ," No, you are doing great.",,,
1377,Jay ," See, this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug. So people don't get hurt.",,,
1378,Phil ," Well, yeah... until you sweep too much under the rug. Then you got a lumpy rug. It creates a tripping hazard. You open yourself up to lawsuit. Boy, you can go a really long time without blinking.",,,
1379,Phil ," Gloria, It's Phil. Can I talk to you for a second?",,,
1380,Phil ," Claire likes to say, you can be part of the problem or part of the solution. Well, I happen to believe that you can be both.",,,
1381,Phil ," Listen, Claire feels terrible. Why don't you talk to her?",,,
1382,Gloria , Why? I know what she thinks... A coal digger.,,,
1383,Phil ," No, she's saying ""gold digger.""",,,
1384,Gloria ," No, Phil...",,,
1385,Phil ," I know she said that, but that was a long time ago, before... she knew you.",,,
1386,Gloria ," Does Jay buy me nice things? Yes, of course! All beautiful things! Look at this. Yellow, red, blue... All the colors. Do you think I can't live without these? Take them away, Phil.",,,
1387,Phil ," We all know you'd be fine without underwear. I mean, we know it's not about that.",,,
1388,Gloria , It's about me not being accepted by my new family.,,,
1389,Phil ," That is not true. Gloria, look, you're a beautiful woman. In fact, you're probably one of those beautiful women who doesn't know it.",,,
1390,Gloria , I know it.,,,
1391,Phil ," So it's natural for Claire to wonder about you and her dad. This family is very protective of each other. I remember the first  time Claire brought me home. Do you think Jay thought I was good enough for his little girl? No way. But, over time, he realized that I loved Claire as much as he did. And by then, Mitch had brought Cam home, so I was golden. Claire just needs a little time. And then, trust me, she'll be the most loyal friend you've ever had.",,,
1392,Jay ," You're not leaving, are you?",,,
1393,Mitchell ," Uh, You know, there's kind of a lot of drama.",,,
1394,Cameron , So we're torn.,,,
1395,Jay ," Let me ask you something. Your sister said that Gloria would never go for anybody who looked like me. Now, you guys basically... are like women. You look at guys. So what do you think?",,,
1396,Mitchell , You're seriously asking us if you're attractive?,,,
1397,Jay ," I know I'm no Erik Estrada or anything. I'm just curious is all. So, if I was in one of your bars and... Righteous Brothers were on, would you... I don't know... Check me out?",,,
1398,Mitchell ," Dad, you're really close to ruining gay for me.",,,
1399,Jay ," All right, fine, whatever...",,,
1400,Mitchell ," Jay, Jay, Jay, now, listen, I think it's... I just think it's a little weird for a son to say this to his father, but, for the record... you're smoking hot.",,,
1401,Jay , Really?,,,
1402,Cameron ," 100%. You're totally my type, dangerous, gettable. You have a little cashola in your pocket.",,,
1403,Jay ," Face, body, the whole...",,,
1404,Cameron ," The whole kit and caboodle, I think",,,
1405,Jay ," Really. What, about a 7?",,,
1406,Cameron , 9. For sure 9. But you knew that.,,,
1407,Jay , I might have lowballed a bit.,,,
1408,Mitchell ," Hey, isn't there a game on?",,,
1409,Jay , Touchy.,,,
1410,Cameron , I know.,,,
1411,Claire ," Gloria? Come on, let's talk about this.",,,
1412,Phil , I've seen her kick in a door before. ,,,
1413,Claire ," I don't know what my husband is saying to you, or why he's covered in your underwear...",,,
1414,Gloria ," Obviously, I'm trying to seduce him for his money. Coz' that's what I do, right? What do I have to give back so that everyone trusts me? These earrings?",,,
1415,Claire & Phil , No...,,,
1416,Gloria , What? This bracelet?,,,
1417,Claire & Phil , No...,,,
1418,Gloria , My new dress?,,,
1419,Claire , No...,,,
1420,Phil , I didn't respond because... this shouldn't be... about me. It should be about you talking to you... about it.,,,
1421,Claire , Phil? Honey...,,,
1422,Phil ," No, no, you're welcome.",,,
1423,Claire ," I don't know what to say except for that I am really, really sorry.",,,
1424,Gloria , Just tell me one thing. How do you really feel that I'm with your father?,,,
1425,Claire ," Uhh, well...Honestly, at first, it was hard. You don't expect to wake up one morning with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap. But... I'm getting used to it. The important thing is you make him happy, which you do, in so many ways. So many colors. Are we okay?",,,
1426,Gloria , No.,,,
1427,Claire , No?,,,
1428,Gloria , You embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs. What? I'm supposed just to forget about it?,,,
1429,Claire , What do you want me to do? Just embarrass myself so we're even?,,,
1430,Gloria , Go jump in the pool.,,,
1431,Claire ," You mean ""go jump in a lake,"" right?",,,
1432,Gloria , Go jump in the pool with your clothe on. Then I know you're sorry.,,,
1433,Claire ," I'm not gonna do that, Gloria.",,,
1434,Gloria , Okay! Then I won't forgive you. ,,,
1435,Jay , Now a field goal beats us! Hey! You guys work that out?,,,
1436,Claire , Almost. Gloria wants me to jump in the pool.,,,
1437,Phil ," Okay, then. What?",,,
1438,Jay ," If they kick... get a pass rush on them, something, a break.",,,
1439,Luke , This is so awesome.,,,
1440,Haley , I know. Mom does not look good wet.,,,
1441,Jay ," Gloria, is this really necessary?",,,
1442,Claire ," Dad, it's fine. If I need to jump in this water to prove to Gloria how sorry I am, I will do it. It's fine. You're seriously not gonna stop me?",,,
1443,Gloria , Why would I do that?,,,
1444,Claire , Because I am standing here. I'm showing you my willingness to... Are you happy?,,,
1445,Gloria , Yesss! I forgive you!,,,
1446,Claire , Then give me your hand.,,,
1447,Jay , That's the oldest trick in the book. She's gonna pull you in there. And that's my job.,,,
1448,Phil ," This is funny, but this is also a teaching moment. Think of all...",,,
1449,Cameron , Cannonball! ,,,
1450,Cameron ," Now get your hands up there, and... like you're lifting me off the ground. Be one with me, Jay. There you go.",,,
1451,Claire , Do you want to get something to eat?,,,
1452,Mitchell , I am never eating again.,,,
1453,Jay , Just snap the damn thing.,,,
1454,Cameron , Perfect. That one kind hurt. ,,,
1455,Cameron , Oh... Come on. How could he fumble that?,,,
1456,Jay , Center blew the snap.,,,
1457,Cameron ," You know, I hate that. I played center and I always got blamed for a quarterback's clumsy hands.",,,
1458,Jay ," Well, I was a quarterback, and it was probably your fault.",,,
1459,Cameron , It's impossible to fumble the ball when the QB has the proper hand placement.,,,
1460,Claire , It's weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to dad.,,,
1461,Mitchell , You want to hear weird? Cam said he'd pick up dad at a gay bar.,,,
1462,Claire , How did that come up?,,,
1463,Mitchell , I'm really trying to block it out.,,,
1464,Claire ," As far as I'm concerned, mum and dad had sex two times.",,,
1465,Mitchell , Agreed.  Modern Family,,,
1466,Claire ," Okay, your brother's lunch is packed, you're buying your own lunch. Luke, Alex, come on. Let's go!",,,
1467,Phil , Hurry up. Last chance for the summer handshake.,,,
1468,Luke , Dad?,,,
1469,Phil ," Come on, we're only halfway done.",,,
1470,Luke , I need help. I was supposed to keep a journal all summer. It's due today.,,,
1471,Claire ," Wow, first day of school, and you're already behind?",,,
1472,Luke , I'm dead.,,,
1473,Claire ," All right, tell me how far you've gotten.",,,
1474,Luke ," Okay. ""June 21st -- found a stick.""",,,
1475,Claire , Mm.,,,
1476,Luke ," ""June 22nd..."" That's it.",,,
1477,Claire , That's it?,,,
1478,Luke , It was a really cool stick.,,,
1479,Phil , He's right. It looked like a snake.,,,
1480,Claire , Getting everybody out of the house in the morning can be really tough. Especially the first day of school.,,,
1481,Phil ,,"00 'til we drop them off at school, It is go, go, go.",,
1482,Claire ,,00.,,
1483,Phil ,,00.,,
1484,Claire ,,00.,,
1485,Phil , That's you? I thought we had a raccoon.,,,
1486,Gloria ," I can't believe my little boy is going into the fifth grade. He used to hold my finger with his little hand and look at me with those big eyes. Oh, mi niño pequeño, Jay!",,,
1487,Jay ," Yep, they grow up. Come on, Manny, let's get going!",,,
1488,Manny , How's my hair?,,,
1489,Jay , Hold on. What are you wearing there? That looks like an old christmas tree skirt. ,,,
1490,Manny , It's a traditional Colombian poncho. I want my new classmates to know I'm proud of my heritage.,,,
1491,Gloria ," Sí. I think you look very handsome, lindo.",,,
1492,Jay ," Oh, really? Am I driving him to school, or is he gonna ride his burro?",,,
1493,Cameron ," * you are a cutie-pie, yes, you are! you are a cutie-pie * Are you still baby-proofing?",,,
1494,Mitchell , Everything we own is pointy. Why is our daughter dressed like Donna Summer?,,,
1495,Cameron ," She is not Donna Summer. Clearly, she's Diana ross from the RCA years. How is daddy not seeing that?",,,
1496,Mitchell , I really thought you were done with this.,,,
1497,Cameron , I made no such promises.,,,
1498,Jay ," I guess I'm somewhat of a shutterbug, um, and my new favorite model, of course, is Lily. I just completed a series of photographs Of her dressed as various pop icons. Let's see, I've done, uh, Olivia Newton-John. I've done Madonna, the early years. Stevie Wonder.",,,
1499,Mitchell ," Yeah, there are days when Lily has more costume changes than Cher.",,,
1500,Cameron , Cher! How could I forget Cher? That's embarrassing.,,,
1501,Mitchell , That's embarrassing? [OPENING CREDITS],,,
1502,Phil ," Honey, you moving out?",,,
1503,Alex , Five more years. A little help here?,,,
1504,Claire , This is why we suggested the violin.,,,
1505,Alex , The cello is more in demand in university orchestras.,,,
1506,Haley , You know what's not in demand?,,,
1507,Alex ," Oh, what?",,,
1508,Haley , Girls who play in university orchestras.,,,
1509,Phil ," Here, I'll help you carry it out to the curb. ",,,
1510,Claire ," Phil, put on some pants.",,,
1511,Phil ," Come on, this covers up more than my bathing suit.",,,
1512,Claire ," Yeah, don't remind me. Haley, honey, don't forget the driving instructor is picking you up from school.",,,
1513,Haley , Can't he pick me up someplace else? I don't want kids at school thinking I'm dating a 40-year-old driving instructor who's not even cute. ,,,
1514,Jay ," I'm sorry, but there's only two places anyone should wear a poncho... Niagara falls and log rides.",,,
1515,Gloria , You think too much about these things. I wear all sort of daring outfits all the time and people admire them because I wear them with the confidence.,,,
1516,Jay , I'm sure it's the confidence they're admiring. I just... I just think it's a little over-the-top. ,,,
1517,Claire , Haley just got her learner's permit,,,
1518,Phil , We've been taking turns driving with her. ,,,
1519,Cameron ,, You know what? You need to loosen up and have fun.,,
1520,Mitchell , I am loose. I'm fun. Remember? Breakfast for dinner last week... my idea.,,,
1521,Cameron ," Ever since we brought Lily home, you've been tense. All you do is put child locks on things, read parenting books. Would you please stop and... Here... just hold your daughter. Hold her and relax.",,,
1522,Mitchell ," All right, sweetheart. Come on.",,,
1523,Cameron , Just relax.,,,
1524,Mitchell ," Oh, sweetheart. Did you put hair spray on this?",,,
1525,Cameron ," Just a little bit, yes. I'm gonna put some music on.",,,
1526,Mitchell ," No, cam, I have to go to work.",,,
1527,Cameron , Dance with her!,,,
1528,Mitchell , I don't have time for this.,,,
1529,Cameron ," Put a little boogie in it. oh, come on. Just dance. You know you love this song. This is actually a really good song. All right. Okay. Who's the dancing queen, huh? Put a little boogie in it.",,,
1530,Mitchell , I don't have time.,,,
1531,Cameron ," See? Fun, right? Oh, my... was that her head?",,,
1532,Mitchell ," No, I think if it was her head, she would be... Yeah, that was her head. Okay, okay. Yes, I know.",,,
1533,Cameron , I got boo-boo bear from the freezer.,,,
1534,Mitchell , Why do you have chocolate on your face?,,,
1535,Cameron , It was under a pie.,,,
1536,Mitchell , So you ate your way to it?,,,
1537,Cameron , I made a judgment call. You weren't there!,,,
1538,Mitchell , Do you think she's all right? ,,,
1539,Phil ," One of the really standard rules of the road is we want to keep a safe distance Between us and the car in front of it, And that is not safe right there! not safe!",,,
1540,Claire ," All right. Okay, merge.",,,
1541,Haley , I...,,,
1542,Claire , Merge.,,,
1543,Haley , Mom...,,,
1544,Claire ," Merge! Merge, merge, merge, merge, merge!",,,
1545,Haley , Stop it! You're freaking me out!,,,
1546,Phil ," This navigation system's all messed up. It thinks we're in a park. Oh, my god, it is a park! Away from the kids!",,,
1547,Haley , Where do I go?!,,,
1548,Phil , Aim for the lake!,,,
1549,Haley , The lake?!,,,
1550,Phil , Aim for the lake!,,,
1551,Claire , Makes you realize we're all just hanging by a thread.,,,
1552,Gloria , The last thing Manny needs on his first day of school is you under-melting his confidence.,,,
1553,Jay , Undermining.,,,
1554,Gloria ," Now you're doing it to me, too.  ",,,
1555,Cameron , She didn't cry that much.,,,
1556,Mitchell , M-maybe that's a bad sign. You know... We should try and make her laugh.,,,
1557,Cameron , Why?,,,
1558,Mitchell ," 'cause that's how we'll know she's okay. Where's, um... Where's doggy? Doggy, doggy.",,,
1559,Cameron ," Here, doggy.",,,
1560,Mitchell ," Okay, there you go. Moo!",,,
1561,Cameron , But it's a dog.,,,
1562,Mitchell ," Yeah, I know. That's why it's funny. Moo!",,,
1563,Cameron , I don't think it's as funny as you think it is. Can we please just call your sister?,,,
1564,Mitchell ," No, no. Cam, cam, why, so she can be all judgmental and condescending. Like she's the expert and I don't know how to take care of a baby?",,,
1565,Cameron ," Mitchell, she is your family. Of course she's gonna be judgmental and condescending.",,,
1566,Claire , Hello?,,,
1567,Mitchell ," Hey, hi. Uh, not a big deal, just wondering... When your kids were small, did you ever...",,,
1568,Claire ," I don't know, uh, smack their heads into a wall? Usually, we just gave time-outs.",,,
1569,Mitchell ," No, no. Accidentally. Um, we... we just kind of bonked Lily's head, And she... it really wasn't very hard, and she's not acting any differently, But I just worry...",,,
1570,Claire ," Relax. It happens. Luke used to bang his head all the time, and he's fine.",,,
1571,Mitchell ," Okay. All right, thank you. Thanks. That helps. Okay, okay. We got to take her to the doctor. Load up the car. ",,,
1572,Jay ," No, what I'm saying... we have the day to ourselves for the first time in months. We should take advantage of it... Go to the club... Nice lunch... Some massages.",,,
1573,Gloria , What about work?,,,
1574,Jay ," I'm the boss. Since I married you, people are surprised I come in at all. ",,,
1575,Jay , Gloria?,,,
1576,Gloria , I'm here.,,,
1577,Jay ," I, uh, just dropped Manny off at school, And I realized... I just dropped Manny off at school.",,,
1578,Gloria ," Oh, boy. And I was hoping we'd still have a few more good years before the mind started to go. ",,,
1579,Claire ," I was sort of looking forward to a quiet day. Thought I'd just read, maybe... Go for a run later. That's it.",,,
1580,Phil , Great. We'll run together.,,,
1581,Claire , You don't have to do that.,,,
1582,Phil , I Know. ,,,
1583,Gloria ," Jay's very spontaneous. He's always surprising me with little presents, fun getaways.",,,
1584,Jay ," I wasn't the greatest husband the first time around, But I'm trying to do better this time. And maybe by my third marriage, I'll have it down pat. Yeah, that one's gonna cost me.",,,
1585,Phil ," Whatcha reading there, a book?",,,
1586,Claire ," Yeah, I've been meaning to get to it for a while.",,,
1587,Phil ," Oh, it's got a map at the beginning. I like it when books do that.",,,
1588,Claire , Uh-huh. Do you have an open house this morning?,,,
1589,Phil , I rescheduled. Thought you might like some company. Ahh.,,,
1590,Phil ," Well, the first day of school can be tough for stay-at-home moms. Now, you have to understand... the kids are gone, The nest is empty, they are rudderless. And a lot of guys wouldn't even notice. But I'm not a lot of guys. I listen with my mind, and if you pay attention, women will tell you what they want by telling you the opposite of what they want. Like, the other day, Claire was like, you have to move your car. There's no space in the garage for both of our cars."" And what she's really saying is that, you know, I should probably get a sports car.  ",,,
1591,Phil , Listening.,,,
1592,Claire ," The thing is, I like to run alone, and I run kind of fast, so...",,,
1593,Phil , So...,,,
1594,Claire ," So, I'm not sure you're gonna be able to keep up with me.",,,
1595,Phil ," You're k... you're kidding, right?",,,
1596,Claire , No.,,,
1597,Phil , You really think I can't keep up with you?,,,
1598,Claire , I'm not sure you can keep up with this conversation.,,,
1599,Phil ," I think you're forgetting that I power-walk every morning and that I wear my special ses with the big soles, which were designed by a doctor.",,,
1600,Claire ," Yes, I know. But I run... every day.",,,
1601,Phil , You really think you can run as fast as me?,,,
1602,Claire ," No, Phil, I think I can run much, much faster...Than you.",,,
1603,Phil , Boom. Just like that the whole day changed. It was game on. She knew it. I knew it. We both knew it.,,,
1604,Claire , I just want to read.,,,
1605,Jay , I think I'll order what I had the last time. What was that called?,,,
1606,Gloria , You just want me to say it because you want me to roll my r's.,,,
1607,Jay , Come on!,,,
1608,Gloria ," Reuben. Jay, what is this?",,,
1609,Jay ," Oh, looks like my old car cover.",,,
1610,Gloria , Don't give me that. This is Manny's poncho. What is it doing here?,,,
1611,Jay , Maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school.,,,
1612,Gloria , What did you say to him?,,,
1613,Jay , Nothing. I told some jokes.,,,
1614,Gloria ," You said plenty with your jokes. Jay, he looks up to you. He respects your opinion. ",,,
1615,Jay ," We dodged a bullet on this, trust me. I've been down this road before. I remember one time Mitchell decided to wear a jaunty scarf to school. I kept my mouth shut. He got his jaunty butt kicked.",,,
1616,Mitchell ," My dad has this perception that I was very flamboyant as a kid, which is just... it's nonsense, because I kept the whole gay thing very under wraps. You know, I was just a guy's guy. I-I was basically a jock. You know?",,,
1617,Gloria ," So, we should crush Manny's spirit and destroy everything that makes him who he is.",,,
1618,Jay ," I'm just saying, it's no fun to see your kid get picked on every day, getting tormented just because he's different. Now, I'm telling you, it rips your heart out.",,,
1619,Gloria ," Well, batman doesn't get picked on, and he wears a cape. A poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around.",,,
1620,Jay , Batman doesn't get picked on because he's a muscular genius. Manny can't make it to the top bunk.,,,
1621,Gloria , We're taking this poncho to Manny at school. It's important that he knows that we support him. And then we go get those massages 'coz that sounded good.,,,
1622,Phil , I always take the stairs two at a time. I don't even think about it anymore. The regular way would seem weird.,,,
1623,Claire ," Phil, let it go. I'm faster than you.",,,
1624,Phil ," If only there was some way we could settle this once and for all, but how? Huh.",,,
1625,Claire , You seriously want to race me? I ran a half marathon last year.,,,
1626,Phil , Wow. I'm half scared.,,,
1627,Claire ," Okay, we do need to do this. I'll go change.",,,
1628,Phil , Not now. I got a conference call. But how about after that?,,,
1629,Claire , Great. This afternoon.,,,
1630,Phil ," Sweet! Two at a time, two at a time, two at a... Son of a gun, got to fix that step. Two at a time, already at the top, so... ",,,
1631,Dr Miura , Hi. I'm dr. Miura. I'm on call today. Looks like we have a little head bump.,,,
1632,Mitchell ," Yeah, it happened a couple hours ago on a doorjamb.",,,
1633,Dr Miura ," Oh, ouch.",,,
1634,Mitchell ," We used to do this thing in school where they would give you an egg, And you... you know, you couldn't break it. And it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent. But... The real thing, it's... it's... it's so much harder.",,,
1635,Cameron ," We did that in my school, too. It didn't turn out so well. Went through a dozen eggs.",,,
1636,Mitchell ," Yeah, well, he's a nervous eater.",,,
1637,Cameron ," No, I broke a dozen eggs.",,,
1638,Mitchell , Oh. I'm sorry. I just assumed that...,,,
1639,Cameron , I know. I know what you assumed.,,,
1640,Dr Miura , There doesn't seem to be any mark.,,,
1641,Cameron ," Well, her head was... somewhat protected.",,,
1642,Dr Miura , Protected? Was she wearing a hat?,,,
1643,Mitchell ," Yes, yes. It was like a hat.",,,
1644,Cameron ," It was a wig. Actually, sort of a ghetto-fabulous afro thing. I thought it might be medically relevant.",,,
1645,Mitchell ," Really? You thought ""ghetto-fabulous"" might be medically relevant?",,,
1646,Dr Miura , Maybe I should just finish with the exam?,,,
1647,Mitchell , Yes. Thanks.,,,
1648,Cameron , You'll be pleased to know that Mitchell and I intend on raising lily With influences from her asian heritage.,,,
1649,Dr Miura , That is fantastic. Have you noticed any vomiting since the head bump?,,,
1650,Mitchell ," Uh, no. No, no.",,,
1651,Cameron ," We've hung some art in her room, some Asian art, And then when she's ready for solid food, There is a fantastic pho place Right around the corner from our house. Am I pronouncing that right? Is it ""pho""? It's a soup. ",,,
1652,Dr Miura ," I don't know. I'm from Denver. We don't have a lot of...Pho there. Just to be sure, Could you show me how hard Lily got hit? And u... use your head.",,,
1653,Mitchell ," Oh, yeah, so, I mean, really, it was... It was just sort of like, um...",,,
1654,Dr Miura , Could I see that again?,,,
1655,Mitchell ," Um, it was just... just a head bump, you know?",,,
1656,Dr Miura , How are you feeling?,,,
1657,Mitchell ," Uh, fine.",,,
1658,Dr Miura ," So is Lily. Babies are designed to survive new parents, so stop worrying. You guys are doing great.",,,
1659,Cameron , Thank you.,,,
1660,Dr Miura , Denver.,,,
1661,Jay ," I don't see any ponchos, Which means either the kids don't wear them or the ones who do wear them disappear.",,,
1662,Gloria , We're doing the right thing.,,,
1663,Gloria ," I support Manny no matter what. Children need to know that you believe in them. It's the most important thing. If you tell them they have wings, they will believe they can fly.",,,
1664,Jay ," Oh, really? I had a buddy went to Woodstock, believed he could fly... didn't end great. It's why hotel windows don't open anymore.",,,
1665,Manny , Is something wrong? Who's died?,,,
1666,Gloria ," No one, Manny.",,,
1667,Jay , Why would you even think that?,,,
1668,Gloria ," In Colombia, Manny went to Pablo Escobar elementary school. If you were pulled out of class, it was definitely to identify a body.",,,
1669,Jay ," Well, we got your poncho here.",,,
1670,Manny , I thought you said it made me look like my neck was wearing a dress.,,,
1671,Jay , That was a joke.,,,
1672,Manny ," Oh, good it's still in the pocket. ",,,
1673,Jay , What do you got there buddy?,,,
1674,Manny , My pan flute. I'm going to play some Colombian folk music for my new classmates.,,,
1675,Jay , Huh. Great.,,,
1676,Gloria , I've never been more proud of you. I'm sure your friends are gonna love it. Break the flute.,,,
1677,Jay , What?,,,
1678,Gloria , The poncho by itself is fine. The poncho plus the flute plus the stupid dance... My son will die a virgin.,,,
1679,Jay , That's right.,,,
1680,Jay ," Hey, sport, can I take a look at that whistle? Oh, geez, look at that!",,,
1681,Gloria , And now you stepped on it!,,,
1682,Jay ," What? Oh, darn! Wh-what's wrong with me?!",,,
1683,Cameron ," Here, let me get it.",,,
1684,Mitchell ,"Thank you. You know what, actually, maybe you should do this. I-I don't want to bump her head against the door, You know, pinch her with the seat belt.",,,
1685,Cameron ," Mitchell, how long are you gonna beat yourself up over one mistake? Is this gonna be like the blond highlights all over again?",,,
1686,Mitchell , I just... I think I suck at being a father.,,,
1687,Cameron , What are you talking about? We're new at this.,,,
1688,Mitchell ," Yeah, but you're such a natural. I mean, look at you. You walk into the room, and she lights up. You... you change her diaper with one hand. I... Nice, I'm actually jealous of you.",,,
1689,Cameron ," There are so many things that you do that I can't. You... you baby-proofed the entire house. You took care of all the adoption paperwork. Without you, we wouldn't even have a baby to injure. Just a couple of forms.",,,
1690,Mitchell ," Actually, that was a lot of paperwork.",,,
1691,Cameron , And you got her on all those preschool waiting lists. ,,,
1692,Mitchell , I can't believe you were gonna wait until she was old enough.,,,
1693,Cameron ," You see, that's what makes us a great team. We each have our own strengths. Now... Who are amazing parents?",,,
1694,Mitchell , We are.,,,
1695,Cameron , I can't hear you.,,,
1696,Mitchell , We are!,,,
1697,Cameron , Don't you forget it.,,,
1698,Mitchell , Okay. Did we just lock our baby in the car?,,,
1699,Cameron , Did you put the keys in the bag?!,,,
1700,Mitchell , I put the keys in the bag. That's what we always...,,,
1701,Cameron ," Oh, Mitchell, I told you not to put the keys in the bag!",,,
1702,Mitchell ," Don't freak out. Come on, don't freak out!",,,
1703,Cameron ," Lily, it's okay!",,,
1704,Mitchell ," * a, b, c, d, e, f, g *",,,
1705,Cameron ," What, are you singing to her? People get arrested for this, Mitchell! We have to keep her calm.",,,
1706,Mitchell ," * h, I, j, k, l, m, n, o, p *",,,
1707,Cameron , Do all four doors lock?! Do you have a phone?!,,,
1708,Phil , what?,,,
1709,Claire , I didn't say anything.,,,
1710,Phil , I couldn't hear you. I'm cranking one of my mash-ups.,,,
1711,Claire , Oh.,,,
1712,Phil ," Hey, hey! There they are. How was the first day back in prison?",,,
1713,Alex , Fine.,,,
1714,Luke , Yeah. What are you guys doing?,,,
1715,Phil , Your mom and I are racing to the mailbox on sequoia and back.,,,
1716,Alex , Why?,,,
1717,Claire , I don't know.,,,
1718,Phil ," Oh, she knows. Hey, buddy, as soon as I'm done kicking a little mom butt here, How about I school you in some Mariokart?",,,
1719,Luke , Can't. Got to work on my journal.,,,
1720,Phil ," Lame! Hey, uh, Alex, you? ",,,
1721,Alex , I have a history paper.,,,
1722,Phil ," Well, if you want see a little history being made right here...",,,
1723,Alex , Not really.,,,
1724,Phil , Okay. Ready?,,,
1725,Claire , Are you?,,,
1726,Phil ," I was born ready. I came out of the womb wearing tiny, little, golden...",,,
1727,Claire , Go!,,,
1728,Phil , ...Wings.,,,
1729,Cameron , I'm breaking the window!,,,
1730,Trina , Emergency assistance. This is Trina.,,,
1731,Mitchell ," Help! We locked our baby in the car, and people are judging us!",,,
1732,Cameron ," I swear to god, I'm gonna break it!",,,
1733,Mitchell , Do not break the window! You'll get glass on her!,,,
1734,Trina ," Sir, please tell your wife to relax. Everything is going to be okay.",,,
1735,Mitchell , That's a man.,,,
1736,Trina , Really?,,,
1737,Cameron ," Don't worry, Lily! Lily, daddy's coming for you!",,,
1738,Trina ," Sir, we just sent the signal. The door should be unlocked now.",,,
1739,Mitchell ," Check... check the door. Check the door, check the door.",,,
1740,Cameron , It's not unlocked! Oh! oh...,,,
1741,Mitchell , Okay.,,,
1742,Cameron , That is amazing. How did they do that?,,,
1743,Mitchell , I don't know. It's just... We got it. Thank you.,,,
1744,Cameron , Did that come from space?,,,
1745,Claire , I run five miles a day. I have a resting heart rate of 48. There is no way I'm going to lose a two-mile race to Johnny Ski Pole.,,,
1746,Phil , Just saving my energy... drafting off of you. You feeling cocky? ,,,
1747,Claire ," Yeah, I am.",,,
1748,Phil , I love it!,,,
1749,Claire ," But after seeing that t-shirt, I realized something. The first day of school is tough on all my kids, especially the one I married.",,,
1750,Phil ," Boo boo boop! Afterburners engaged! Ooh! Don't choke on my smoke! And down the stretch he goes! I don't believe it! Daddy wins! Do you believe in miracles?! U.S.A.! U.S... Oh, no!",,,
1751,Claire ," Oh, geez!",,,
1752,Haley ," Oh, my... What was that?! Was that a person?!",,,
1753,Phil , I'm good!,,,
1754,Haley , Dad?!,,,
1755,Phil , I'm good! I'm good!,,,
1756,Claire , Are you okay?,,,
1757,Phil ," You're getting better, sweetheart.",,,
1758,Claire ," Did I lose the race to make him feel better? Maybe. But it just seemed like he could use a win today. We do strange things for the people we love. We lie to them. We lie for them. There may be some bumps along the way, But we never stop wanting the best for them. That's what makes it such a tough job... But kind of the best job in the world.",,,
1759,Claire , What are you doing?! Keep your eyes on the road!,,,
1760,Phil , Eyes on the road!,,,
1761,Alex ," Oh, my god! Oh, my...",,,
1762,Phil , oh. Uh-oh. ‘Kay.,,,
1763,Claire ," All right, sweetie, this happens. Remain calm. That's the first thing. Pull over right here. I'll get out the registration.",,,
1764,Haley ," Mom, I don't like cops.",,,
1765,Claire ," Okay, pull over right there.",,,
1766,Haley , I don't like cops.,,,
1767,Claire ," All right, there's a space right here.",,,
1768,Haley ," I can't pull over. No, I can't.",,,
1769,Claire , You need to pull over. ,,,
1770,Haley , I can't pull over. I don't like cops.,,,
1771,Claire , You got to pull over.,,,
1772,Phil , No can do. I got priors.,,,
1773,Haley , I'm speeding up.,,,
1774,Phil ," The parking ticket from the mall... I never paid the parking ticket! Keep moving, sweetheart!",,,
1775,Haley , Dad agrees with me... I can speed up!,,,
1776,Claire ," It's not a movie, Haley! Pull over!   Modern Family",,,
1777,Gloria ," Bravo! Bravo, Manny, bravo!",,,
1778,Jay ," Well, when I heard Manny wanted to fence, I was like, ""sure. uncoordinated kid, lethal weapon... How can this go wrong?""",,,
1779,Gloria , And what do you think now?,,,
1780,Jay ," I'm proud of our little Zorro. I mean, I worked with him a little, but the kid's got skills.",,,
1781,Gloria ," It's in his blood. His father was a master swordsman. He was an artist with his sword. I mean, the way he throws the sword... I mean, he was legendary.",,,
1782,Jay ," You know, this nice moment I'm having with your son... You're... Kind of wrecking it.",,,
1783,Gloria , Sorry.,,,
1784,Alex , Did you know that fencing goes back to the 12th century?,,,
1785,Haley , You know what's even nerdier than fencing? Knowing when it began.,,,
1786,Luke ," I don't think you're a nerd, Alex.",,,
1787,Alex ," Shut up, dork.",,,
1788,Jay , All right! That's my boy!,,,
1789,Mitchell , Would this be easier if we suspended you from a crane?,,,
1790,Cameron , Any monkey can shoot a home movie. I pride myself on shooting home films.,,,
1791,Mitchell ," Yeah, but, Cameron, you always just take things a little too far.",,,
1792,Cameron ," No, I don't.",,,
1793,Mitchell ," Okay, your nephew's first birthday.",,,
1794,Cameron , That's not fair.,,,
1795,Mitchell , You brought a wind machine.,,,
1796,Cameron ," To be fair, my vision was...",,,
1797,Mitchell ," Cameron, you brought a wind machine.",,,
1798,Cameron , Who puts wheels on cribs? ,,,
1799,Gloria ," Mi tigre! Mi tigre! Yes! Ay, sorry. Sorry.",,,
1800,Phil , That's okay.,,,
1801,Haley ," No! No, no, no, no, no! My phone died!",,,
1802,Alex , No biggie. Your battery probably just statically defracticated.,,,
1803,Haley , What?,,,
1804,Alex , It means you can recharge it with static electricity. Just rub it on your hair.,,,
1805,Jay ," Yes! You know, I used to go to the houses of my friends, And it used to bug me, their kids you know?, Because there was never a trophy in my house. Not until this one.",,,
1806,Phil , That's a good grip ! Can we switch seats?,,,
1807,Mitchell ," Cam, people are staring.",,,
1808,Jay ," I know you're not supposed to care, but it's kind of cool to have a kid in your house who's the best at something, you know what I mean?",,,
1809,Phil , Mm-hmm.,,,
1810,Phil ," Yeah, our kids are great.",,,
1811,Claire , They're the greatest.,,,
1812,Phil ," Gosh, we're blessed.",,,
1813,Claire ," We are. But, um... Are they the best at something? I'd have to think about that.",,,
1814,Phil ," Well, Alex is great at every single thing she tries, So, you know, she'll find her specialty.",,,
1815,Claire , She will. And... and Haley is...,,,
1816,Phil , Haley is so pretty.,,,
1817,Claire , Gorgeous.,,,
1818,Phil ," Oh, gosh. Gorgeous girl. I mean... So, she can meet someone who's the best at something.",,,
1819,Claire , That's right.,,,
1820,Phil ," And then, I guess that leaves Luke. We dropped the ball a little bit on that one.",,,
1821,Claire ," Yeah, a little bit.  [OPENING CREDITS] ",,,
1822,Presenter , How about a nice round of applause for our winner; Manny Delgado.,,,
1823,Everyone ," Bravo, bravo!",,,
1824,Presenter ," Manny now moves on to the championship, where he'll be competing against Caroline Markum. We'll see you all",,,
1825,back here at 4,30.,,,
1826,Jay , All right! What she said.,,,
1827,Claire , Wow. This means more to dad than it does to Manny.,,,
1828,Mitchell ," Yeah, it's his chance to be, you know, father of a champion. Well, second chance. But we all know how the first time went.",,,
1829,Claire , Did I say something wrong?,,,
1830,Mitchell ," No. No. I'm... I'm very happy for Manny, that's all. Everything's not always about Claire. Geez.",,,
1831,Jay , I want to thank you guys for coming by and supporting the kid. You guys are the best.,,,
1832,Phil ," Why, Claire?!",,,
1833,Claire ," Come on, sweetie.",,,
1834,Mitchell ," Really? Well, that took a while.",,,
1835,Cameron ," Well, she's been asleep for 20 minutes. It just took me some time to sneak out without waking her up.",,,
1836,Mitchell , Kind of like the first time you slept over here.,,,
1837,Cameron ," I had a meeting. All right, let's talk about why you got your panties in a bunch. What's up with you and your sister?",,,
1838,Mitchell , Nothing is up.,,,
1839,Cameron , Mm-hmm. Or could this have something to do with... Ice skating?,,,
1840,Cameron , When Mitchell and Claire were kids...,,,
1841,Mitchell , This is interesting to no one. ,,,
1842,Cameron ," Excuse... please let me finish. Thank you. When Mitchell was 10... 11... and Claire was 13, they were competitive ice dancers.",,,
1843,Mitchell ," Figure skaters. Oh, for god's sakes, I'll tell the story. Yes, my sister and I were actually a very good team. We were called ""fire and nice."" I was ""fire,"" 'cause of the red hair, and Claire was ""nice"", because it was ironic and she wasn't.",,,
1844,Cameron , And Mitchell is still upset because Claire quit the team right before some meet.,,,
1845,Mitchell , some meet? The 13-and-under regional championships. Just the emerald city at the end of my yellow brick road.,,,
1846,Cameron , Wow. You did it.,,,
1847,Mitchell , What?,,,
1848,Cameron , You made figure skating sound even gayer.,,,
1849,Cameron ," So, seeing your dad so proud of Manny didn't stir up any resentment?",,,
1850,Mitchell , Mnh-mnh.,,,
1851,Cameron ," Okay. Okay, fine, you always do this. Instead of letting your feelings out, you bury them, and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways.",,,
1852,Mitchell ," Okay, you know what, you... Yes, all right. Listen, I might still be holding a little resentment, but that's... Embarrassing and petty, And it's not a good color on me. It's kind of like you and yellow.",,,
1853,Cameron , You love me in my yellow shirt.,,,
1854,Mitchell , It makes you look like the sun.,,,
1855,Cameron , Okay. Bubbling. Hurtful bubbling. Now you know why I left early that morning.,,,
1856,Mitchell ," Ha! I knew you didn't have a meeting, Cam! I knew it!",,,
1857,Haley ," There must be something wrong with this phone. I've rubbed it on my head for, like, an hour.",,,
1858,Claire , What? Alex.,,,
1859,Haley ," Oh, you're such a geek!",,,
1860,Alex , At least I didn't give myself a bald spot. ,,,
1861,Haley ," Oh, my god! Mom!",,,
1862,Claire ," Alex, don't be mean. Haley, stop making yourself such an easy target.",,,
1863,Phil ," This feels right, buddy. I'm telling you, this feels right.",,,
1864,Claire , What are you guys doing?,,,
1865,Phil ," Pursuing excellence. We made a list of areas the boy might excel at, and... baseball!",,,
1866,Claire , Love it.,,,
1867,Phil ," Yeah. I read it only takes 10,000 hours to achieve excellence. You've already got, like, what, how many hours playing ball?",,,
1868,Luke ," Well, I played, like, one season. So, like, 6,000 hours?",,,
1869,Claire ," Yeah, I can see why you ruled out math.",,,
1870,Claire," Yeah, of course I want Luke to be successful, but I don't think that a parent can just force that. I think you just have to have faith that the kid's gonna find his own way. Besides, Luke already is the best at something... Being my son. It sounded a lot less lame in my head.",,,
1871,Phil , I have got a good feeling about this. This is gonna be your sport.,,,
1872,Luke ," Last year, you said basketball was my sport.",,,
1873,Phil ," Look, I've said a lot of things I wish I could take back, But I can't. What I can do is be the dad you need me to be to help you become masterful. You want to be masterful?",,,
1874,Luke , I guess.,,,
1875,Phil ," There's my killer! Okay. Our journey of 10,000 hours begins with a single pitch. I believe in my boy! I ain't gonna quit you. Let's burn one in here. That's good. That's a good start. Okay, you... Rest that cannon while I run this down, okay? Okay. Let's keep all the batters right here. Oh! Should have... should have worn my cup. Should have worn my cup. Home run! This one's really in here, buddy. Okay. Very, very, very, very good first hour. Toss me your glove. I'll put some oil...On it. Yeah.",,,
1876,Jay , Everything okay? ,,,
1877,Gloria ," Yes, I was telling my grandmother how great was Manny today.",,,
1878,Jay ," So, that wasn't angry talk?",,,
1879,Gloria ," No, silly, that was happy talk.",,,
1880,Jay ," Ah, I'm beginning to understand Why there's so much conflict on your continent. Here, check this out.",,,
1881,Gloria ," Aw, Jay. Jay loves to make t-shirts for special occasions. Come on, baby, show them.",,,

1912,Manny , That's really as loud as I can go.,,,
1913,Phil ," What does it take to make a great salesman? It's no big secret. You just follow the abc's of salesmanship... always be closing. Don't ever forget great home ideas just keep lurking mostly nearby. Often, people question realtors' sincerity. Take umbrage. Violators will... Oh, shoot, ""x,"" ""x,"" ""x""...",,,
1914,Phil ," And this is the great room, Although ""great"" hardly seems to do a room like this justice. Weird squiggly painting not included.",,,
1915,Woman , I actually love it.,,,
1916,Phil ," I do, too. It's really beautiful. Um, all... all custom built-ins. And you'll notice just... just tons of natural light, So that's great.",,,
1917,Phil ," Did I need the sale? Yes. Was I worried? No. Why? Because. Because why? Because I won't sell anything I don't believe in. And when I believe, you believe. I can sell a fur coat to an Eskimo.",,,

1947,Claire ," Hey, guys! I brought orange slices.",,,
1948,Cameron ," Okay, you know what? I can't bear this. Claire, Mitchell still resents you for quitting the figure-skating team when you were kids. Ladies, come inside with me, please. Work it out. Come on.",,,
1949,Mitchell ," Thanks, cam.",,,
1950,Claire , Is he serious? Is that what your little jab was about this morning?,,,
1951,Mitchell ," Okay, no... yes. Okay, yes. Yes, I'm... I guess I'm still a little angry. But, you know, you stole my moment, Claire.",,,
1952,Claire ," Yeah, 21 years ago.",,,
1953,Mitchell ," Okay, no, but it doesn't matter to you because you had your own moments. You had cheerleading and high-school plays and, uh, making out with the quarterback and...",,,
1954,Claire ," Oh, come on. You made out with him, too.",,,
1955,Mitchell ," Yeah, but we had to keep it a secret. You shouldn't have quit. It was selfish.",,,

1958,Claire ," No, come on.",,,
1959,Mitchell , Press conferences?,,,

1996,Phil , Oak. Also known as nature's pillow.,,,
1997,Luke , It's like ice.,,,
1998,Phil ," Now, let's not start blaming the floors. You shouldn't have been running.",,,
1999,Luke , I saw a ghost.,,,
2000,Phil , G-ghost? Hey... Phil Dunphy. O-kay. That's me. That's acting like a natural shoehorn. Okay. Probably better all take our shoes off for this part of the tour. Follow me.,,,

2010,Mitchell ," I am not claiming that any of this is rational. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being such a pill, okay?",,,
2011,Claire ," I... Actually always felt very guilty for quitting. Look, I know how much you loved figure skating. ",,,
2012,Mitchell , I...Never really loved skating.,,,
2013,Claire ," Uh, what?",,,
2014,Mitchell ," um, all right. This is gonna sound a little gay. But, um, when... when you and I skated together, You know, you weren't the mean older sister and I wasn't the... the clingy little brother. We were... we were a team. And, well, let's face it, We've kind of grown apart in the past few years, And... and with mom and dad's divorce, we were on opposing sides, and I just...I... I just... I miss being on your team.",,,
2015,Claire , That's...,,,

2029,Jay , Of course she is.,,,
2030,Jay , Let's get out of here. Let's get this thing in the trunk. I can't decide if I'm feeling more proud or mortified.,,,
2031,Gloria , How about now?,,,
2032,Jay," We tell our kids it doesn't matter if you win or lose, but let's be honest, winning feels pretty great. There's nothing like that golden moment in the sun. I think every parent probably wants that for their child. You know, maybe a little bit for ourselves, too. ",,,
2033,Phil , Buddy!,,,
2034,Jay ," So, sometimes, we push too hard. And that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt. So, how much is too much? Here's where I come out. Guilt fades. Hardware is forever.",,,

2071,Claire , You don't like it?,,,
2072,Phil ," Are you kidding me? I love it. It's so creative. Coupons for hugs, which are usually free, but this makes it official, which is so great.",,,
2073,Claire , I was so proud of myself when I thought of it because you're impossible to buy for. You never want anything. ,,,
2074,Phil ," Things I want... Robot dog, night-vision goggles, bug vacuum, GPS watch, speakers that look like rocks. I love my wife, but she sucks at giving gifts. I'm sorry for the pay-channel language, but... Yogurt maker. I can't not think of things I want. [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
2075,Cameron , Can't tell if she needs a diaper change.,,,

2086,Mitchell , Sal!,,,
2087,Cameron ," Raise the roof, Lily. We're calling Sal.",,,
2088,Cameron ," Sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world. The reason we love her so much is she has absolutely no inhibitions, and that's before she starts drinking. Hanging out with her is like an Amsterdam Saturday night every day of the week.",,,
2089,Mitchell ," And, ironically, Sal's not allowed back into Amsterdam, any day of the week.",,,
2090,Gloria ," Of course we would love to have the baby, all the other cousins are sleeping over tonight.",,,
2091,Jay ," The more, the merrier.",,,

2104,Alex , Maybe if you wore a bra.,,,
2105,Claire , Alex...,,,
2106,Alex , What? I can't wait to go to Grandpa's. Family means everything to me.,,,
2107,Haley , Because you have no friends.,,,
2108,Alex ," Because I love Grandpa, and he's getting older. Who knows how many years he has left?",,,
2109,Luke , Is Grandpa dying?,,,

2217,Jay ," Hi, honey.",,,
2218,Haley ," Gee, you scared me. How did you...",,,
2219,Jay ," Light bulb went out. You don't change right away, you never get around to it. There. Now I can see everything that goes on around here.",,,
2220,Jay , I've had a little practice at this. Haley wasn't throwing anything at me I hadn't seen before from her mother and then some. But nobody gets off the rock.,,,
2221,Izzy ," Right, here's a track. Wasn't so popular in America. Got to number six on the Netherlands' charts, though. That whole  summer, I couldn't walk to the corner in Amsterdam without mobs of birds coming up and asking me for the double bubble.",,,
2222,Phil ," Okay, just play it, I think. Yeah. He's awesome, honey.",,,
2223,Claire , You're welcome.,,,
2224,Izzy ," *Tonight. So right. So right. Lover.* Hey, Phil, I think your lover wants a kiss from you.",,,
2225,Phil ," Oh, okay...",,,
2226,Izzy ," Come on, man. She's not your sister. Give her a proper snog. That's a bad joke. Not funny. My sister lost her feet to complications from diabetes.",,,
2227,Phil ," Can I get you some water there, guy, or...",,,
2228,Izzy , You got tea?,,,
2229,Claire ," Yes, of course. I'll get that.",,,
2230,Izzy ," Yeah, chamomile.",,,
2231,Claire , You don't miss a minute.,,,
2232,Izzy ," Oh, God. Why did... Look at what I'm doing. I'm making it all about me. What a downer. It's your evening. Let's make it great. Name your playlist. I'll do it all.",,,
2233,Phil , Just the classics. Let's play the hits.,,,
2234,Izzy ," We'll get to the hits, obviously. Go to the back catalog. Favorite B-side.",,,
2235,Phil ," That's fun! Yeah, that's fun. Just... I'm so bad with titles.",,,
2236,Izzy ," Hum it. Just did that one, didn't I?",,,
2237,Phil ," That's right. It's in the noodle. So, I guess...",,,
2238,Izzy , What album is that on?,,,
2239,Phil , Second. I want to say second.,,,
2240,Izzy , What's on the cover?,,,
2241,Phil ," There's a warlock, I think. Or a seascape.",,,
2242,Izzy ," Oh, ""Millennium Sunrise""?",,,
2243,Phil ," ""Millennium Sunrise.""",,,
2244,Izzy ," There is no ""Millennium Sunrise"" record.",,,
2245,Phil , What? What?,,,
2246,Izzy , You're not a fan-dau. You didn't even know who I was at the door. I saw it in your eyes. Am I being Punk'd?,,,
2247,Phil , This means so much to Claire. I don't want to hurt her feelings. ,,,
2248,Izzy ," Her feelings? Well, what about my feelings? This is my career, man. My music was the soundtrack to people's lives. Now I'm nothing. How do you think that feels? This is really humiliating.",,,
2249,Phil , Don't go. Don't go!,,,
2250,Claire , What are you guys doing?,,,
2251,Phil , He let me touch it.,,,
2252,Mitchell ," I think she said ""kill,"" Cam. I do.",,,
2253,Cameron , Maybe it was just a joke. She's always had a dark sense of humor.,,,
2254,Mitchell , That's true. Remember her Halloween costume?,,,
2255,Cameron , When she came as Siegfried and part of Roy?,,,
2256,Mitchell , It was too soon.,,,
2257,Cameron , This was just a joke.,,,
2258,Mitchell ," Yes! Yes. Oh, here she comes. I'm gonna bring up Lily. We'll see what she says.",,,
2259,Cameron , Show her some pictures.,,,
2260,Sal ," Pay up, bitches!",,,
2261,Mitchell , More drinks.,,,
2262,Sal , Free drinks!,,,
2263,Mitchell ," Sal, you've got to look at these pictures.",,,
2264,Sal , What are they of?,,,
2265,Mitchell , It's Lily at the zoo.,,,
2266,Sal ," Oh, cute.",,,
2267,Mitchell , Look at that one.,,,
2268,Sal ," Cute, cutie cute, cute, et cetera. So, you guys are gonna have to bring Lily to Cabo, now that you're the guys that always bring Lily.",,,
2269,Cameron ," Well, you know... probably.",,,
2270,Mitchell ," Yeah, probably.",,,
2271,Sal , I will throw her in the ocean.,,,
2272,Cameron , What?,,,
2273,Sal , I said I got to go pee.,,,
2274,Cameron ," Okay, that wasn't even close.",,,
2275,Mitchell , Nope. ,,,
2276,Cameron ," I mean, what do we do? Do we say something?",,,
2277,Mitchell ," How do we even bring it up? She threatened our child, and that's your concern, a segue?",,,
2278,Cameron , You know what this is?,,,
2279,Mitchell , What?,,,
2280,Cameron ," This is first-child syndrome. It's where the first child is happy, and then the second child comes along, and the first child gets jealous of the second child and starts acting out.",,,
2281,Mitchell ," Yes, that's brilliant, except Sal's not our child.",,,
2282,Cameron ," Well, think about it. We've practically done everything for her. We've held her when she's cried. We've carried her when she couldn't walk. We've done everything but potty-train her.",,,
2283,Sal ," Hey, guy! I was thinking... Oh, sorry... that when we go to Cabo, we have find a hotel with a swim-up bar 'cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool's game. Okay, let's get more drinks.",,,
2284,Mitchell ," Sal, Sal, we got to talk.",,,
2285,Cameron , It's about Lily.,,,
2286,Sal ," Oh, shocker.",,,
2287,Mitchell , Do you think it's at all possible that maybe you're jealous of her?,,,
2288,Sal , What?!,,,
2289,Mitchell , It's just... I don't know.,,,
2290,Sal , What?! Why would you say that?,,,
2291,Cameron ," You won't look at any pictures of her, and you talked about killing her and throwing her in the ocean.",,,
2292,Sal ," That was a joke. You guys, come on! We're fine. Show me the pictures of Yoko.",,,
2293,Mitchell , See?,,,
2294,Sal ," Okay, it's a joke. You guys, come on! Because she's Asian and she broke up our group.",,,
2295,Mitchell , I just... Let's at least acknowledge that things have changed between us.,,,
2296,Cameron , And you know what? Because Lily's here doesn't mean we love you any less.,,,
2297,Mitchell ," No, absolutely not. ",,,
2298,Sal ," We used to be really close, and you used to call me a lot. And now you never call me.",,,
2299,Mitchell ," Well, but we...",,,
2300,Sal ," And last week, I had a really bad dream, and I was thinking, ""Okay, I'm gonna call them,"" and then I thought, ""Oh, no! You can't call them because ""you might wake up their baby!""",,,
2301,Mitchell ," You can always call. Oh, honey, always call us. I'm sorry we haven't been there. We're here now, okay? Feel better?",,,
2302,Cameron , I think you just put a little spittle.,,,
2303,Mitchell , Did she just fall asleep?,,,
2304,Cameron , I wish Lily would do the same. Give her eight shots of tequila.,,,
2305,Gloria , I don't understand why she's not falling asleep.,,,
2306,Alex , I have a theory.,,,
2307,Jay ," I got the movie. Manny, why don't you go fire up some popcorn? You looking for these?",,,
2308,Haley , You took my shoes?,,,
2309,Jay ," No, I took your freedom. Sorry, it ain't your night.",,,
2310,Haley , Why are you being like this? I just wanted to go to that party for like two hours. I would have been back by now! Would that have killed you?!,,,
2311,Jay , She's just like her mother.,,,
2312,Gloria , Why are you treating Haley like this?,,,
2313,Jay , Me? She's the one acting like a pill.,,,
2314,Gloria ," You're taking this too personally. When I was Haley's age, I loved my grandfather, but I still wanted to go to parties and be with boys.",,,
2315,Jay ," I know, I know, so did Claire... and Mitchell. But you know what? You try to put something over on me, you're gonna lose.",,,
2316,Gloria , So what? Now you're gonna make this into a big game?,,,
2317,Jay ," I'm trying to keep them around a little bit longer, that's all. Who knows how many nights like this I got left?",,,
2318,Luke , I miss you already! ,,,
2319,Jay ," What's wrong with this kid tonight? Go in the kitchen and help out the guys, and I'll be right in.",,,
2320,Gloria ," It's great that you want to spend time with your granddaughter, but is this really the way?",,,
2321,Jay , Fine.,,,
2322,Gloria , You're a good abuelo. She's upstairs.,,,
2323,Jay , I know. Dylan.,,,
2324,Dylan , Yeah?,,,
2325,Jay ," Get up. You're here to take Haley to the party, right?",,,
2326,Dylan , Yeah...,,,
2327,Jay , She's in the house.,,,
2328,Dylan , How did you know I was here?,,,
2329,Jay , This is how I first met Phil.,,,
2330,Haley ,,00.,,
2331,Jay , I will track you down.,,,
2332,Haley , I believe that.,,,
2333,Dylan , What's that smell?,,,
2334,Jay , Sloppy Jays. Help yourself. There's plenty left.,,,
2335,Dylan , Sloppy Jays because your name's Jay. Right on.,,,
2336,Manny , I can't believe she's into this guy.,,,
2337,Gloria ," If you want, I'll fix you a plate.",,,
2338,Dylan ," Yeah, definitely. That'd be great.",,,
2339,Haley , What about the party?,,,
2340,Dylan ," We can go in just a minute. Just let... Oh, no way! ""The Gunfighter""! I love this movie!",,,
2341,Haley ," Dylan, the party.",,,
2342,Dylan ," Oh, but... cowboys.",,,
2343,Gloria ," Don't fight it, Haley. They never grow up.",,,
2344,Manny , I'm going to the kitchen for an espresso. Anybody need anything?,,,
2345,Haley ," No, thanks.",,,
2346,Izzy ," Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4.",,,
2347,Claire ," ""The year was 1991. America was immersed in Desert Storm. Meanwhile, stateside, another storm was brewing... in my heart."" This is stupid, isn't it?",,,
2348,Phil , No. ,,,
2349,Izzy ," Is it stupid, Phil?",,,
2350,Phil ," Just keep going, Claire. It's wonderful.",,,
2351,Caire ," ""After a romantic dinner at Fratelli's, a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss as the radio played this song.""",,,
2352,Izzy ," You know what? No, no. Sorry. Sorry. Not gonna do it, no.",,,
2353,Claire , What's wrong? What's going on?,,,
2354,Izzy ," Do you know the name of this song? Right. ""True.""",,,
2355,Phil ," ""True"", of course.",,,
2356,Izzy ," This is false. I'm not gonna play ""True"" for someone who's false. He doesn't even know the band. He's not a fan.",,,
2357,Claire ," Of course he does. Because this is our song. You love this song. Tell him this is our song. Tell him, Phil.",,,
2358,Phil ," It's not our song, Claire. Our song is ""If You Leave"" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.",,,
2359,Claire , Are you sure?,,,
2360,Phil , Pretty sure. I sang it at our wedding.,,,
2361,Claire ," Oh, I'm an idiot.",,,
2362,Izzy ," Well, actually, he's the idiot. He fell in love to a breakup song.",,,
2363,Phil , Ignore him. This is beautiful. I love it.,,,
2364,Claire , I hate this. I hate this.,,,
2365,Claire ," You're so sweet and nice and I can't even give you a decent anniversary present. I love you so much, and I feel like you just are never gonna know it.",,,
2366,Phil , I know it.,,,
2367,Claire , You do know it?,,,
2368,Phil , I know it. Yes.,,,
2369,Claire , You do?,,,
2370,Phil , And this is an awesome gift. Do you know why?,,,
2371,Claire , Why?,,,
2372,Phil , You just gave us a new song.,,,
2373,Izzy ," Suppose it's all brought you back together, eh?",,,
2374,Phil , Sort of.,,,
2375,Izzy , Rekindled fires of a dying passion?,,,
2376,Phil , Sure.,,,
2377,Izzy , Shot a ray of hope into this gloomy suburban life? ,,,
2378,Phil ," All right, buddy.",,,
2379,Claire ," Maybe you could just play it, Izzy.",,,
2380,Izzzy ," For you, Claire.",,,
2381,Sal , She is so sweet.,,,
2382,Cameron , Isn't she?,,,
2383,Sal , Like a little angel. Let me hold her.,,,
2384,Luke ," Oh, thank God.   Modern Family",,,
2385,Jay , Do we know anything?,,,
2386,Mitchell ," Oh, no. They're in there now with the doctor. We're lucky, though. The paramedics said it could've been a lot worse.",,,
2387,Jay ," My God, how did this even happen?",,,
2388,Phil ," There he is. Big day's coming up. What do you want for your birthday, big dog?",,,
2389,Luke , It's okay. I'm good.,,,
2390,Phil ," Come on. The sky's the limit. Dream big, my boy.",,,
2391,Luke ," Well, I guess I could use a belt.",,,
2392,Claire , A belt?,,,
2393,Luke ," Yeah, you're right. I don't need it. An extension cord works pretty good.",,,
2394,Phil ," Every year, Luke's birthday falls right around Thanksgiving, and so it gets lost in the holiday shuffle.",,,
2395,Claire ," Yeah, one year we forgot completely, and we had to improvise a cake out of stuffing.",,,
2396,Phil ," Which, by the way, he was fine with. He's one of those kids, you get him a gift, and all he wants to do is play with the box.",,,
2397,Claire ," Yeah, one year we actually just got him a box... a really nice box.",,,
2398,Phil , And we made the mistake of putting it in a gift bag.,,,
2399,Claire , So he played with the gift bag.,,,
2400,Phil , W-we can't get it right.,,,
2401,Claire , No.,,,
2402,Phil , I feel terrible.,,,
2403,Claire , We got to do something.,,,
2404,Phil ," Oh, yeah.",,,
2405,Claire ," Um, well, you know, the family is gonna be together for Thanksgiving for the first time in, I don't even know how long, so-- ",,,
2406,Phil , I am so with you... we should blow this out and throw Luke the best birthday party of all time.,,,
2407,Claire ," Yes, yes, and we'll order a whole bunch of pizzas, and... and... and set up an arts-and-crafts table.",,,
2408,Phil , A what?,,,
2409,Claire ," Yeah, a crafts table. You know, everybody gathers around, and they make stuff, and, then, bam, they got their own party favor.",,,
2410,Phil ," Sorry, I fell asleep while you were describing the most boring party ever.",,,
2411,Cameron , See you in a few hours.,,,
2412,Phil , Yeah. Thanks again for the karaoke machine. I'll get it back to you right after the party.,,,
2413,Cameron , That'd be great.,,,
2414,Mitchell , Please don't. I beg you. Don't. Don't bring it back.,,,
2415,Cameron ," Hey, Phil, are you getting a clown for today?",,,
2416,Phil ," Oh, no, Luke... Luke's not much of a clown fan.",,,
2417,Cameron , Really?,,,
2418,Phil ," Yeah, he never liked them.",,,
2419,Cameron , Has he ever seen a good one?,,,
2420,Phil ," Has... has anyone? Really? So, anyway, thanks again. Okay, yeah, see you later.",,,
2421,Cameron ," No clown? No, no clown?",,,
2422,Mitchell , Let it go.,,,
2423,Cameron , Who throws a party without a clown?,,,
2424,Mitchell ," Since the late '30s, I'd say most people.",,,
2425,Cameron , You know what? We haven't gotten Luke a present yet. Maybe a clown could be our present.,,,
2426,Mitchell ," Cameron, Cameron, if Phil and Claire wanted to get Luke a clown, they would've. This is not our party.",,,
2427,Cameron , But...,,,
2428,Mitchell , This is not our party.,,,
2429,Cameron ," But... fine. What would you suggest we get him, then?",,,
2430,Mitchell , Get him a gift card.,,,
2431,Cameron , A gift card? ,,,
2432,Mitchell , Yeah.,,,
2433,Cameron , Who hurt you?,,,
2434,Jay ," Hey, Gloria, you got any idea how to wrap one of these things?",,,
2435,Gloria , Is that a crossbow?,,,
2436,Jay , Yeah. Am I the greatest grandpa in the world or what?,,,
2437,Gloria , We can't give Luke a crossbow. He pokes himself in the eye every time he uses a straw.,,,
2438,Jay , Are you kidding? I had one when I was his age. My dad used to give me a quarter for every crow I bagged.,,,
2439,Gloria ," And I used to have a machete, but times have changed.",,,
2440,Jay ," He'll be fine. I'll teach him how to use it. Hey, pal. How's it going?",,,
2441,Manny , Am I charming?,,,
2442,Jay ," Oh, boy.",,,
2443,Gloria , Of course you're charming. Who said you were not charming?,,,
2444,Manny ," No one, but there is a girl in my school, and I want her to like me. I need your advice, Jay.",,,
2445,Jay , Really?,,,
2446,Manny , She's gonna be at Luke's party.,,,
2447,Jay ," Well, I'm... a little thrown. I mean, you don't usually come to me for advice.",,,
2448,Manny ," Well, this is one area in which you've done pretty well.",,,
2449,Gloria , He has a point.,,,
2450,Manny ," I've tried everything to get her attention... Opening doors, having a milk sent over in the cafeteria. Nothing has worked.",,,
2451,Jay ," Here's the deal. Girls don't go for all that romantic stuff. They go for power and success. And since you don't have either one of those things, you're gonna be the funny guy.",,,
2452,Phil ," No, no, no, no, no. I-I want the most dangerous reptile you've got.",,,
2453,Tanya , I have an iguana that eats crickets. ,,,
2454,Phil ," That'd be scary if it was a birthday party for crickets. Seriously, Jungle Tanya, I need you to step it up a notch. Is there anything that scares the cocoa out of you?",,,
2455,Tanya ," Uh, not really. I do have a bearded dragon.",,,
2456,Phil , Ooh. Does it...,,,
2457,Tanya ," No, it does not breathe fire.",,,
2458,Phil ," Well, then, we're back to square one, aren't we?",,,
2459,Cameron ," I couldn't get Luke out of my mind. I know I made a promise to Mitchell, but some things are bigger than promises. Fizbo would be at that party. Hello, old friend.",,,
2460,Haley , It all happened so fast.,,,
2461,Jay , I keep thinking there was something I could've done.,,,
2462,Mitchell ," Oh, don't blame yourself. Who could have possibly seen it coming?",,,
2463,Claire ," Sweetie, t-that's a rock wall. Is that even safe? Oh, my God.",,,
2464,Phil ," Honey, relax. Hey, has anyone ever gotten hurt on one of these things?",,,
2465,Man ," I don't know, man. It's my first day.",,,
2466,Phil , See? They wouldn't let the new guy do it if it weren't...,,,
2467,Claire , That did not make me feel better.,,,
2468,Phil ," Don't worry, I signed like a hundred releases.",,,
2469,Claire , When did we decide all this? I-I think it's too much.,,,
2470,Phil ," See, I knew you'd say that. That's why I didn't tell you. So just relax. Grab a snow cone.",,,
2471,Claire , There's a snow-cone machine?,,,
2472,Phil , Yeah.,,,
2473,Haley ," Mom, just so you know, Dylan cannot have mayonnaise.",,,
2474,Claire , That's random. Why are you telling me that?,,,
2475,Haley ," Uh, 'cause he's coming to the party.",,,
2476,Claire , Is that absolutely necessary?,,,
2477,Alex ," Yes, because she can't go 10 minutes without her boyfriend's tongue in her mouth. It's like he's feeding a baby bird. ",,,
2478,Haley , Don't be so jealous. I'm sure you'll meet someone super hot at computer camp.,,,
2479,Claire , Girls.,,,
2480,Phil ," Hey, hey. So, what you got there?",,,
2481,Claire ," Oh, these are supplies for the crafts table. I finally figured out what we're gonna be making.",,,
2482,Phil , Kids bored? I'm teasing. I'm teasing. It looks good. What... what is it?,,,
2483,Claire ," Comb sheaths. I know, I know. But we made them when I was 11 years old at Donna Rigby's birthday party. At first, we thought it was really stupid, and then we had a blast, so...",,,
2484,Phil , How could you not? You combined the two things that kids love the most... Combs and sheaths. I'm kidding!,,,
2485,Claire ," Where's my comb? Oh, here it is, in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath that I made at Luke's awesome birthday party. Hole in one, Mrs. Dunphy. Hole in one.",,,
2486,Mitchell ," I'm home. I got Luke a video game, but it's about math, so... guess we're those kind of uncles. Cam?",,,
2487,Cameron , Don't be mad.,,,
2488,Mitchell ," Oh... Cam, I...",,,
2489,Cameron ," I've known I wanted to be a clown since I found out clowns were just people with makeup. Um, as a matter of fact, by the time I was a teenager, if I wasn't in school or fishin', I was clownin'. There are four types of clowns... A tramp, an auguste, a whiteface, and a character. I am a classically trained auguste clown named Fizbo. What?",,,
2490,Mitchell ," N-nothing. Between the clownin' and the... the fishin', I'm surprised you had time for the schoolin'. Oh, and there's the fifth type, the sad clown.",,,
2491,Cameron , The sad clown is a tramp. So there's still only four types.,,,
2492,Mitchell ," Cam, I thought we discussed this. ",,,
2493,Cameron ," We did, but I-I started thinking. And this isn't about you or me. This is about a little boy who deserves some happiness.",,,
2494,Mitchell , And he's gonna get that from his weird gay-clown uncle?,,,
2495,Cameron ," Fizbo is not gay, he's asexual.",,,
2496,Mitchell , Ah.,,,
2497,Cameron , H-he's an innocent whose only drive is to bring people joy and laughter and balloon animals. He's... he's the least sexual being on Earth.,,,
2498,Mitchell ," Oh. Oh, okay, we, at least we agree on something, yeah.",,,
2499,Phil ," If this tape is found in the future, this is how we humans celebrated birthdays.",,,
2500,Luke ," Hey, Dad!",,,
2501,Phil ," Yeah, there's my boy, zip line extreme... Oh! Ugh! I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. Lesson learned. Don't stand... Don't stand there. Let's go ahead and rope this area off. Excellent. Thank you. Hey, buddy. You having fun?",,,
2502,Luke ," Yeah, and I love my new belt.",,,
2503,Claire ," Hey, Luke! Luke, do you want to make a comb sheath?",,,
2504,Luke , A what?,,,
2505,Claire , It's a cool leather holder for your comb. And you can decorate it. I've got beads and... and glitter and... and all kinds of stuff. Do you want to?,,,
2506,Luke ," Nah, I'm gonna do the rock wall.",,,
2507,Claire ," Okay, honey, it's your day.",,,
2508,Phil ," Honey, let me know if you get low on supplies. I'll make a quick run back to the 1950s for you. Aah! Again?! Seriously, zipline guys, just some ropes.",,,
2509,Cameron , Did you remember to switch the whites to the dryer?,,,
2510,Mitchell ," Oh, no, I forgot.",,,
2511,Cameron , They're gonna smell musty.,,,
2512,Mitchell , I know. I'm sorry.,,,
2513,Cameron , I'll pump.,,,
2514,Mitchell ," No, no, no, I'll do it. You just stay right here and relax. ",,,
2515,Cameron ," Oh, I get it. You're worried about people seeing me.",,,
2516,Mitchell , Without question.,,,
2517,Cameron ," You know, people are gonna stare. They're not used to seeing one clown in a car.",,,
2518,Manny , That's her... Bianca Douglas.,,,
2519,Gloria , She's so cute.,,,
2520,Manny ," Yeah, and she has good handwriting. She's the complete package. Wish me luck.",,,
2521,Jay ," You don't need luck. You just remember those jokes I told you, hmm?",,,
2522,Manny , We have to stop meeting like this.,,,
2523,Bianca , What?,,,
2524,Manny , We go to school together.,,,
2525,Bianca ," Oh, yeah.",,,
2526,Manny , Do you like jokes?,,,
2527,Bianca , Sure.,,,
2528,Manny ," Great. Okay. So, a grasshopper named Gary walks into a bar. Oh, no. You're not supposed to know his name. Let me try another one, okay? Knock, knock.",,,
2529,Bianca , Who's there?,,,
2530,Manny , Interrupting cow.,,,
2531,Bianca , Interrupting cow who?,,,
2532,Manny ," Moo. Oh, crap.",,,
2533,Mitchell ," Um, hey.",,,
2534,Man ," Hey, yourself. Move.",,,
2535,Mitchell , You kind of just bumped me with your car.,,,
2536,Man , I don't think so.,,,
2537,Mitchell ," No, no, you did, because, um, see, yeah, I got grease on my pants, and then also I felt it.",,,
2538,Man , Call an ambulance.,,,
2539,Mitchell ," Okay, I just thought you might want to know in case you wanted to be a decent human being and apologize, but... no? Okay. Ass. ",,,
2540,Man , What did you say?,,,
2541,Mitchell ," Just forget about it, all right?",,,
2542,Man ," Listen, carrot top, I didn't touch you, so do the smart thing... Shut your hole, get in your car, and drive away.",,,
2543,Cameron , Is there a problem here?,,,
2544,Man , What the hell are you?,,,
2545,Cameron ," I'm the ass-kicking clown that'll twist you like a balloon animal. I will beat your head against this bumper until the airbags deploy, so apologize to my boyfriend right now!",,,
2546,Man , Apologize... boyfriend?,,,
2547,Cameron , Apologize!,,,
2548,Man , Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,,,
2549,Cameron , Let's go. We're gonna be late.,,,
2550,Gloria , Mind if I come in?,,,
2551,Manny , Sure.,,,
2552,Gloria , Come here. Why you bounce so sad?,,,
2553,Manny , I told all my jokes. It turns out I'm not the funny guy.,,,
2554,Gloria ," The right girl will find you when it's time, even though I'm gonna hate losing you to another woman.",,,
2555,Manny ," You'll never lose me, Mom. I'll always love you, no matter what.",,,
2556,Gloria ," Oh. You see right there? You need no tricks. Just be the sweet, wonderful little boy that you are.",,,
2557,Manny , Sweet little boy... Got it. She won't know what hit her.,,,
2558,Claire ," Hey, Manny, want to make a sweet comb sheath?",,,
2559,Manny ," Could not be a worse time, Claire.",,,
2560,Phil , Oh. It's so peaceful and quiet over here.,,,
2561,Claire ," Ha ha. If you came over here to gloat, I already know it's a dud.",,,
2562,Phil ," Actually, I came to give you this. It's your favorite flavor... Blue.",,,
2563,Claire ," Thanks, honey.",,,
2564,Phil , And your hair looks really nice.,,,
2565,Claire ," Mm, thanks. I've been combing it all day. ",,,
2566,Tanya , All right. Let's all give Luke a big hand or being so brave.,,,
2567,Luke , It feels so weird. What does it eat?,,,
2568,Tanya ," Oh, just little-boy brains.",,,
2569,Alex ," Well, at least Luke's got nothing to worry about.",,,
2570,Dylan , Is there mayo in this?,,,
2571,Haley ," No, you're good. Um, so, I was thinking that maybe we could go slip away.",,,
2572,Tanya ," So, does anyone want to pet the iguana?",,,
2573,Dylan ," Hells, yes. Oh, man. I love lizards. What's his name?",,,
2574,Tanya , Her name is Lizzy.,,,
2575,Dylan , Wow. I totally get that.,,,
2576,Alex , You don't deserve this.,,,
2577,Haley , What?,,,
2578,Alex ," Hot reptile chick, you know, probably has her own apartment, obviously okay touching gross stuff.",,,
2579,Haley , They're just talking.,,,
2580,Alex , You're right. Dylan's far too sophisticated to get sucked in by a single lady with tons of cool tattoos.,,,
2581,Dylan , Hey. I think it peed on me.,,,
2582,Tanya ," Oh, no. No way, mother nature.",,,
2583,Dylan , I can't believe he does that.,,,
2584,Jay ," Hey, what am I missing, guys? Aw, geez, Gloria.",,,
2585,Gloria ," Jay, look! I go high! Look, look!",,,
2586,Jay ," Hey, guys, hit the road. Come on, you're family men. Come on, scat.",,,
2587,Phil ," Great job, buddy. Now comes the fun part. Rappel down.",,,
2588,Luke , It's really high.,,,
2589,Phil ," You have nothing to fear but fear itself... and the concrete, but I'm right here, buddy.",,,
2590,Luke ," Okay, just catch me.",,,
2591,Phil ," I am brave. Roller coasters? Love them. Scary movies? I've seen ""Ghostbusters"" like seven times. I regularly drive through  neighborhoods that have only recently been gentrified. So, yeah, I'm pretty much not afraid of anything...",,,
2592,Cameron ," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody! Quit your clowning around. That's my job!",,,
2593,Phil ," Except clowns. Never shared that with the fam, so I do have an image to maintain. I am not really sure where the fear comes from. My mother says it's because, when I was a kid, I found a dead clown in the woods, but who knows?",,,
2594,Cameron ," Hey! Oh! Well, you must be the birthday boy.",,,
2595,Luke ," Wow. Is that you, Uncle Cam?",,,
2596,Cameron ," Well, no, I'm Fizbo the Clown. I don't know who this ""Uncle Cam"" is. But he sure sounds handsome, doesn't he? Hey, who likes balloon animals?",,,
2597,Kids , I do! I do!,,,
2598,Phil , It's just Cam. It's just Cam.,,,
2599,Mitchell , You all right?,,,
2600,Phil ," What? Yeah. No, I just have kind of a... complicated relationship with clowns.",,,
2601,Mitchell ," Oh, well, join the club.",,,
2602,Manny ," Look, I came on strong with that whole funny-guy bit. This is me just being myself.",,,
2603,Bianca ," Okay. Hey, do you know who that boy is over there?",,,
2604,Manny , Oh. That's Dylan. He's Haley's boyfriend.,,,
2605,Bianca , He's so cute and tall.,,,
2606,Manny , I'm still growing. Give me a break.,,,
2607,Cameron ," Pardon me, miss, but this little doggy needs a new home.",,,
2608,Bianca ," Oh, thank you.",,,
2609,Jay , That's quite an impressive getup you got there.,,,
2610,Cameron ," Well, thank you, Jay. Oh, by the way, you have something on your shoulder. ",,,
2611,Jay , That's good.,,,
2612,Cameron , Never mind. It was nothing.,,,
2613,Jay ," Yeah, we're done here.",,,
2614,Dylan ," So, do you keep these at, like, a zoo or something?",,,
2615,Tanya ," No, I just keep them at my place.",,,
2616,Dylan , That's awesome. I only have a cat.,,,
2617,Tanya , Yeah? I used to have a cat.,,,
2618,Alex ," I was just messing with you before, but, seriously, he's still talking to her?",,,
2619,Haley , On it.,,,
2620,Tanya ," You know, this is one of...",,,
2621,Dylan , I feel like Britney Spears.,,,
2622,Tanya , You're so funny. You kinda do look like Britney Spears.,,,
2623,Dylan , Oh really? I was kidding.,,,
2624,Tanya ," Um, anyway, this is probably my favorite.",,,
2625,Haley ," Hey, Jungle Lady, I think... I think one of your bugs got out.",,,
2626,Tanya , What? This one?,,,
2627,Haley ," This box thing here... It's on its side, empty.",,,
2628,Tanya ," Oh, my God, where did it go?",,,
2629,Dylan , Is everything okay?,,,
2630,Tanya ," No, I lost a poisonous scorpion, and I need to find it. Okay, kids, um, let's all tuck our pants into our socks, avoid shady, moist places, and let's make a game of looking where we step.",,,
2631,Alex , Is he okay?,,,
2632,Mitchell , Can we see him?,,,
2633,Claire ," He's in with the doctor right now. These things happen, right, no matter how careful you are?",,,
2634,Luke ," Hey, look what Grandpa gave me... a crossbow.",,,
2635,Claire ," Sweetie, that does not look safe.",,,
2636,Luke , Don't worry. He's gonna show me how to use it.,,,
2637,Claire ," Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. ",,,
2638,Jay ," Come on, you ready?",,,
2639,Mitchell ," Oh, my God, you are not making comb sheaths.",,,
2640,Claire ," I am, and I know. It's really lame. Everybody hates it.",,,
2641,Mitchell ," No, it's just like, uh, Donna Rigby's party.",,,
2642,Claire ," Exactly, yes, and it has the beads and everything.",,,
2643,Mitchell ," Oh, amazing. This is awesome. Wow.",,,
2644,Claire ," So, Cam's a clown.",,,
2645,Phil , I got you!,,,
2646,Mitchell , Yeah.,,,
2647,Phil , I totally got you!,,,
2648,Claire , And there's mine. Do you think it's weird that we both chose people who are so...,,,
2649,Mitchell , Uninhibited?,,,
2650,Claire ," I was gonna say embarrassing, but, yeah. Look at them, though. They're the life of the party.",,,
2651,Phil , Oh yeah.,,,
2652,Mitchell ," You know, I got to say, for all his craziness, I love my clown.",,,
2653,Claire , Me too. They're good for us. I would've totally tanked this party.,,,
2654,Mitchell ," Oh, and I would've gotten my butt kicked at a gas station.",,,
2655,Claire , Sorry?,,,
2656,Mitchell , It turns out Fizbo is a real badass.,,,
2657,Cameron , Aah! Aah! Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion!,,,
2658,Phil ," No, no. Too close. Too close. Too close.",,,
2659,Jay ," What the hell? Oh! Oh, crap!",,,
2660,Claire , What happened?,,,
2661,Luke , He fired the crossbow.,,,
2662,Claire ," Oh, my God!",,,
2663,Manny ," Bianca, I'm coming.",,,
2664,Claire , Who else is in there? Get out!,,,
2665,Manny , Aaaahh!,,,
2666,Manny , It turns out I'm not the sweet guy or the funny guy. ,,,
2667,Gloria ," No, Manny, don't go in, por favor!",,,
2668,Manny , I must! I'm coming!,,,
2669,Manny , Manny Delgado is a man of action.,,,
2670,Bianca , Wait. My dog... It's still in there.,,,
2671,Manny , I'll be right back.,,,
2672,Luke , Ow! My arm!,,,
2673,Claire , Sweetie? Luke? What...,,,
2674,Phil , What happened?,,,
2675,Claire ," What happened, honey?",,,
2676,Phil ," Hey, hey, hey, hey, what happened?",,,
2677,Luke , I slipped on these stupid beads.,,,
2678,Claire , Oops.,,,
2679,Phil ," Come on, here we go.",,,
2680,Luke , Ow!,,,
2681,Gloria , How is he?,,,
2682,Claire ," Oh, he's gonna be fine.",,,
2683,Jay ," Hi, honey. Hey, Manny.",,,
2684,Everyone ," Uh-oh, there he is.",,,
2685,Gloria , Poor thing!,,,
2686,Luke ," Wow, everybody's here.",,,
2687,Jay , Of course we are. How's that busted flipper?,,,
2688,Luke , Okay.,,,
2689,Phil ," Sorry about today, buddy. We'll try again next year, huh?",,,
2690,Luke , Are you kidding? This was the best birthday ever.,,,
2691,Claire , What?,,,
2692,Luke , I got a cast.,,,
2693,Claire , You like the cast?,,,
2694,Luke ," I've always wanted one. After a few weeks, they start to smell.",,,
2695,Alex , You are so weird. You know that?,,,
2696,Manny , Can I sign it?,,,
2697,Luke , Sure. ,,,
2698,Alex ," Hey, me first.",,,
2699,Manny , Okay.,,,
2700,Phil ," If you'd asked me before the party if I wanted there to be a chain reaction of disasters that led to Luke breaking his arm, I probably would've said no.",,,
2701,Claire , Probably?,,,
2702,Phil ," Prob... definit... Definitely not, would not want that. But one way or another, Luke was the center of attention on his birthday, and the whole family was together, just the way it should be.",,,
2703,Cameron , Fizbo delivery! I brought the cake!,,,
2704,Phil ," I can't do this. Okay, I'm out.",,,
2705,Claire , Cake!,,,
2706,Gloria ," Blow... blow the candle, Luke. Blow the candle.",,,
2707,Manny , Bianca Douglas called me three times tonight. I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm starting to feel smothered.,,,
2708,Luke ," I really like my cast, but it's starting to itch. Good thing my mom made me this personal scratcher. Oh, that's good stuff.",,,
2709,Haley ," If another woman is messing with your man, you have to get proactive. I don't care how pretty she is or how many stupid reptiles she has, she tries to take what's mine, girlfriend's gonna get stung.   Modern Family ",,,
2710,Phil , Anyway... Merry christmas! [OPENING CREDITS] ,,,
2711,Haley , Do we really have to wear these ugly sweaters?,,,
2712,Claire , It's just until grandma can see them.,,,
2713,Luke , My neck hole is too small.,,,
2714,Alex , Mine's itchy.,,,
2715,Luke , I'd rather be itchy than choky.,,,
2716,Claire ," Come on, Phil. Hurry up.",,,
2717,Phil ," Okay, here we go. Connecting. Come in, Florida! Over! Mom? Dad?",,,
2718,Frank ," Hello, Phillip.",,,
2719,All, Merry Christmas eve!,,,
2720,Frank , Merry Christmas eve!,,,
2721,Phil ," A little... little lower, dad.",,,
2722,Frank , Merry Christmas eve.,,,
2723,Claire , Thank you... thanks for the sweaters!,,,
2724,Frank ," Oh, you're welcome. You look beautiful in them, darling.",,,
2725,Phil , Where's mom?,,,
2726,Frank , Mom is sinking fast. She's in the bathtub.,,,
2727,Phil ," They have that claw foot. I know, yeah. Hey, pops, here's the tree. And, uh, there... there's the, uh... There's the ornament you sent us.",,,
2728,Claire , Right here. Right here.,,,
2729,Phil ," There are the stockings, Hung by the chimney by Claire.",,,
2730,Frank ," Oh, still funny, son.",,,
2731,Claire , What the hell is that? What is that? That looks like a cigarette burn. Was one of you smoking a cigarette?,,,
2732,Kids , No.,,,
2733,Claire , Which one of you was smoking?,,,
2734,Phil , Not me. I have a respiratory problem.,,,
2735,Claire ," Obviously, it wasn't you. Now I've got a family of liars and smokers.",,,
2736,Frank ," Honey, come here. You got to see this.",,,
2737,Claire ," Did you shoplift your Christmas presents, too? Haley, keep that ugly sweater on. ",,,
2738,Jay , Are you crying?,,,
2739,Manny ," What are you, a robot?",,,
2740,Jay , It's a deeply emotional movie.,,,
2741,Gloria ," Manny, mi amor, I need you to help me in the kitchen.",,,
2742,Jay ," We got to finish this first, Gloria. The kid's never seen ""miracle on 34th street.",,,
2743,Gloria ," That's because he always spends Christmas in Colombia With my family. And all we see there is ""Salazar and el oso save Christmas.""",,,
2744,Jay , Sounds like a classic.,,,
2745,Gloria , It is.,,,
2746,Manny ," Mom, can we finish the movie?",,,
2747,Gloria , Okay.,,,
2748,Jay , Aah! What the hell is that? What the hell is that?,,,
2749,Manny , Inocente!,,,
2750,Jay , What the hell?,,,
2751,Manny ," When you told me we were going to watch this movie, I got a joke copy from the internet. You are the inocente!",,,
2752,Jay ," Well, maybe I'm a little confused right now. What is this inocente stuff?",,,
2753,Gloria ," In Colombia, practical jokes are a Christmas tradition. The one that is fooled is the inocente!",,,
2754,Jay ," We tell practical jokes on April fool's day. Do not do that again. Inocente. Does it do it again? Ah, it's ruined.",,,
2755,Mitchell , Are you kidding me with this line? I'm gonna ask Santa for the last 45 minutes of my life back.,,,
2756,Cameron ," Oh, would you cheer up? We're in Santa's village with our daughter. Where were we a year ago?",,,
2757,Mitchell ," Uh, we were at the beginning of this line.",,,
2758,Cameron ," Okay, you know what? Somebody needs to get in the holiday... Son of a bitch. ",,,
2759,Mitchell , Maybe it's not them.,,,
2760,Cameron ," Oh, it's them. It's them.",,,
2761,Cameron ," Three years ago, I formed a caroling group. We were known as ""the Greensleevers."" We would perform at charity events, hospitals.",,,
2762,Mitchell ," And they were very, very popular.",,,
2763,Cameron ," Uh, last year... One of my carolers... Andrew... Staged a little coup... and, he, um...",,,
2764,Mitchell , They kicked Cameron out of the group.,,,
2765,Andrew , Thank you. We're the new Greensleevers.,,,
2766,Cameron ," The new Greensleevers? Is there a slap mark on my face? I mean, why is Edna singing the low harmony? It's like people are applauding out of shock.",,,
2767,Mitchell , Let it go.,,,
2768,Elf ," Okay, next.",,,
2769,Mitchell ," Oh, finally. Whoa. Um, I'm sorry. Can I... could... could you... What happened to the other Santa? Listen, we've been waiting in this line for a really long time, and we just want a Santa that actually looks like Santa.",,,
2770,Cameron ," Mitchell, it's okay.",,,
2771,Mitchell ," No, no, no, Cam. It's not okay. This is Lily's first Christmas. I want to make sure everything is perfect. And we're gonna wait for the fat Santa.",,,
2772,Elf , I knew this would happen. I-I don't even know why we hired this guy.,,,
2773,Mitchell , See? Even his elf agrees with me. Thank you.,,,
2774,Cameron , I didn't know Christmas made you so petty. Lackluster! I hate you!,,,
2775,Claire , This is unacceptable. And I want to know who did this. Hmm?,,,
2776,Phil ," Nobody, huh? I guess the couch did it to itself. I guess it came home after a tough day, lit up a cigarette, and then it burned itself. Is that what happened? Because that makes no sense. ",,,
2777,Claire ," If whoever is responsible doesn't come forward, Your father and I are just gonna have to punish all three of you.",,,
2778,Alex , What?,,,
2779,Claire , Yeah.,,,
2780,Luke , That's not fair.,,,
2781,Phil ," I can forgive the smoking, But I can't forgive the lie...",,,
2782,Claire , Phil.,,,
2783,Phil ," Or the smoking. No one wants to confess, huh? No? That's fine. 'cause you know what happens next? We cancel Christmas.",,,
2784,Luke, That's not fair.,,,
2785,Alex ," Okay, dad, sure.",,,
2786,Claire , Phil has a habit of making big pronouncements to the kids.,,,
2787,Phil ," One time I told Luke that if he didn't put his dirty dishes in the dishwasher, we would put them in his bed.",,,
2788,Claire , Phil's problem is follow-through.,,,
2789,Phil ," We had no more dishes, So we were eating cereals out of the goldfish bowl.",,,
2790,Phil ," Okay, Guess where I'm headed. To take down the tree. That's right.",,,
2791,Claire ," Come on, guys. Whoever did is, just take responsibility. Don't put the rest of us through this. Luke? No?",,,
2792,Phil ," This is really it, okay? Here we go. 3...2...1... Okay. Goodbye, Dunphy Christmas. Haley, I guess you're not getting that car.",,,
2793,Haley , I was getting a car?!,,,
2794,Phil ," No, I was lying, because that's what we do now. Dunphys are liars.",,,
2795,Cameron ," When I was in charge, it was all about music. I mean, what's with them tossing out candy canes after every carol?",,,
2796,Mitchell , It's pandering. I think you made that clear when you tossed them back.,,,
2797,Cameron ," Okay, how am I supposed to get all this in the car?",,,
2798,Santa/Scott , Let me give you a hand with that. ,,,
2799,Cameron ," Uh, thanks. Thanks... thanks, Santa.",,,
2800,Santa/Scott , Can't call me that anymore. Just got canned.,,,
2801,Mitchell , Oh. Really?,,,
2802,Santa/Scott , Guess a couple of people complained I wasn't fat enough.,,,
2803,Cameron ," Well, that's terrible.",,,
2804,Santa/Scott , That's what I get for trying not to have a second heart attack. There you go. Always a way to make room. Take it from someone who lives in his car.,,,
2805,Mitchell ," Um...Oh, well, thank you so much.",,,
2806,Santa/Scott , No problem. Merry Christmas.,,,
2807,Mitchell ," Um, wait, wait. Um, please, let me give you a little something. For... for your troubles.",,,
2808,Santa/Scott ," No, that's okay. No, really, that's okay.",,,
2809,Cameron , Do you really live in your car?,,,
2810,Santa/Scott ," Yeah, it's not so bad. It's pretty roomy since the wife moved out. Well...",,,
2811,Cameron , Why don't you come over to our place for dinner tonight?,,,
2812,Santa/Scott , Seriously?,,,
2813,Cameron ," Yeah, it's Christmas eve. You... you can't spend it in your car.",,,
2814,Santa/Scott ," Wow, that's really nice of you guys. Listen, can I bring anything? Ketchup, soy sauce, straws?",,,
2815,Cameron , We're good.,,,
2816,Mitchell ," So, uh, why don't you follow us to our house?",,,
2817,Santa/Scott , Okay. In your house. All right.,,,
2818,Mitchell , Cameron.,,,
2819,Cameron , What?,,,
2820,Jay ,,"00 sharp, we open one present each...",,
2821,"Pajamas, which we sleep in. Tomorrow morning, 7","00 A.M., Manny on the stairs for the Christmas picture. Then we open presents.",,,
2822,Manny ," In Colombia, they open presents at midnight and stay up till morning. ",,,
2823,Jay ," I'm sure that they do, But as you'll notice from the absence of goats in the street, We are not in Colombia. Come on, I'm kidding.",,,
2824,Gloria , Why can't we mix a couple of Colombian traditions in?,,,
2825,Jay , Like what?,,,
2826,Manny , Like fireworks.,,,
2827,Jay ," Come on, you don't have fireworks in Colombia. You're trying to make me the inocente again.",,,
2828,Gloria ," No, we do. At night, the sky is beautiful, very Christmasy.",,,
2829,Jay , That doesn't make any sense.,,,
2830,Gloria ," Look, every country has their own traditions. In our culture, for example, the baby jesus is the one that brings the gifts, Not the Santa Claus.",,,
2831,Jay , But that doesn't make sense. How could a newborn baby carry all those presents? They don't even know where their hands are.,,,
2832,Manny , At least a baby can fit through a chimney.,,,
2833,Jay ," How would you sit on the baby Jesus' lap? You'd squish it. Manny, next year, we'll talk about some of your little Colombian traditions, okay? Maybe.",,,
2834,Manny ," I know what ""maybe"" means. It's like you're trying to take away my whole Christmas.",,,
2835,Haley , I can't believe it's all gone. Dad never follows through.,,,
2836,Alex , Are you sure one of your friends didn't burn the couch?,,,
2837,Haley ," Hey, don't look at me. Only one of us was ever caught playing with matches. Luke.",,,
2838,Luke , That was a year ago. Just admit you did it.,,,
2839,Haley , You admit you did it!,,,
2840,Alex ," Okay. Look, I have an idea. Do you remember the movie ""Spartacus""? Here's what we do... Luke, you tell mom and dad it's your fault.",,,
2841,Luke , I didn't do it.,,,
2842,Alex ," It doesn't matter, because after you confess, Haley and I will each confess to the same thing.",,,
2843,Haley , How does that do anything? ,,,
2844,Alex , They'll be so touched that we're protecting each other that they'll have to bring back Christmas.,,,
2845,Luke , That's awesome. How does it work again?,,,
2846,Claire , We're gonna pass into legend... The parents who canceled Christmas.,,,
2847,Phil , I thought you'd be happy.,,,
2848,Claire ," They'll write songs about us, Make one of those Christmas specials With those ugly little clay people.",,,
2849,Phil , You're the one who always says I shouldn't be a pushover with the kids.,,,
2850,Claire , So this is where you decide to make your stand?,,,
2851,Phil ," Okay, okay, look, don't worry. We're going to have Christmas. We raised our kids right. Whoever did it will come forward... Or the other two will rat them out.",,,
2852,Luke , Mom? Dad?,,,
2853,Phil ," Hey, Luke. What... what can we do for you?",,,
2854,Luke , I did it. I was playing with matches. I'm sorry.,,,
2855,Phil ," You, uh... You did the right thing by confessing, But, um... This is bad, buddy. I mean, really bad, okay? Claire, you want to handle this?",,,
2856,Claire ," Um, Luke, why didn't you say something?",,,
2857,Luke ," Mm...I don't know. Okay, well, your father and I are extremely disappointed in you. So go up to your room. Go on.",,,
2858,Luke , Alex!,,,
2859,Claire , We'll be up to talk to you in a minute.,,,
2860,Luke , Haley!,,,
2861,Haley , What?,,,
2862,Luke , Say something!,,,
2863,Alex , About what?,,,
2864,Luke , I take it back!,,,
2865,Claire , What is going on?,,,
2866,Luke ," These guys were gonna say they did it, too, And you were gonna be proud of all of us.",,,
2867,Haley , Why would we do that?,,,
2868,Alex , I don't know what to believe with this kid. ,,,
2869,Luke , Liars! I didn't do it!,,,
2870,Haley ," Well, it wasn't me.",,,
2871,Alex , Don't look at me.,,,
2872,Claire , Seriously?,,,
2873,Phil ," Wait. Nobody did it again? No, that's fine. Guess what... Christmas is still canceled. That's fine by me. I'll start working on next year. Hey, and memo to New Year's eve and Easter... Watch your back!",,,
2874,Santa/Scott ," So, after I left the marines, I just kind of traveled the world. Now I go from town to town picking up odd jobs.",,,
2875,Cameron ," Oh, kind of like the Hulk.",,,
2876,Santa/Scott ," that's weird. That was my... that was my nickname in the corps. 'cause of my bad temper. Anyway, thanks for having me over and having me for dinner, letting me do my laundry. This has not been a good day.",,,
2877,Mitchell ," Um, Scott, I-I have a confession to make.",,,
2878,Santa/Scott , Yeah?,,,
2879,Mitchell ," Um... I didn't cl.. I didn't clean the lint tray, So, um, your clothes might be a little pilly.",,,
2880,Santa/Scott ," Oh, no problem. That's the least of my worries. Thanks for everything. You guys made my day.",,,
2881,Cameron , It's the least we could do.,,,
2882,Santa/Scott , What do you mean?,,,
2883,Cameron , I don't know... what I was saying. I-I just say we never tell him.,,,
2884,Mitchell ," Exactly. We give him some money, a hot al, laundry. I think we're square.",,,
2885,Cameron , Agreed.,,,
2886,Mitchell ," Okay, how does this thing work?",,,
2887,Cameron ," Yeah, I think you just press that button right there in the middle.",,,
2888,Mitchell ," Yeah. Oh, my... Okay, that... well, that seems a little high, doesn't it?",,,
2889,Cameron , Yes. I'm not putting Lily in that. It's like something astronauts train in. ,,,
2890,Jay," Ho, ho, ho! It's me! Ho, ho, ho! It's me!",,,
2891,Cameron , It's your dad.,,,
2892,Mitchell ," Yeah. Hey, dad. Hi.",,,

2895,Jay ," Well, these are your Christmas eve gifts. You know the drill.",,,
2896,Mitchell ," Oh, yeah.",,,
2897,Jay , You open those up before bedtime. They're pajamas.,,,
2898,Mitchell , Still keeping traditions alive.,,,
2899,Jay ," Well, someone has to. I got two Colombians at home trying to turn Christmas into cinco de mayo.",,,
2900,Mitchell ," You know that's Mexican, right?",,,
2901,Jay ," Ah, burrito, bur-right-o. Christmas should be Christmas. Picture on the stairs, hot chocolate, opening the presents. That was supposed to be the good thing about having a kid in the house again, I can have Christmas the way we used to.",,,
2902,Cameron ," I hear you, Jay. If I was home right now, I'd be mixing up a bathtub full of eggnog and trying to squeeze a greased hog into a Santa hat. You don't think I miss that?",,,
2903,Mitchell , Do you?,,,
2904,Cameron ," The point is that those are memories that I'll always have, But now I have the perfect opportunity to create new memories with my new family that are gonna be just as special someday.",,,
2905,Mitchell , Cam's right. We create new traditions every year.,,,
2906,Santa/Scott , So...Who's ready to try the swing?,,,
2907,Gloria ," Now, remind me, we put this into the oven first thing",,,
2908,tomorrow 'cause Jay wants to eat at 3,"00. Ay, Manny. Did you put this spider in the fridge?",,,
2909,Manny ," Oh, yeah. Inocente.",,,
2910,Gloria ," Oh, papi, what's wrong?",,,
2911,Manny , I want to have Christmas like they do in Colombia. Jay is messing everything up. ,,,
2912,Gloria ," Manny, try to understand. Jay has great memories with his kids when they were young. And he just wants to re-create them with you.",,,
2913,Manny ," So, maybe the best gift I could give Jay Would be Christmas like he used to have it?",,,
2914,Gloria ," You're such a beautiful boy. One day, you're gonna grow up and I'm gonna miss all the things that you used to do as a little boy.",,,
2915,Manny ," Okay, but if this so-called Santa Claus doesn't bring me a burgundy dinner jacket, we're going to have a big problem.",,,
2916,Phil , Honey?,,,
2917,Claire , Hmm?,,,
2918,Phil , Would it really be so bad to back down?,,,
2919,Claire , And have the kids never take any of our threats seriously again?,,,
2920,Phil , Yeah.,,,
2921,Claire , Mm.,,,
2922,Phil , Or the kids could realize that we're making a supreme sacrifice by giving up our power to save their Christmas.,,,
2923,Claire ," Which would, in a way, be the greatest gift that we could ever give them.",,,
2924,Phil , And which would paradoxically make them respect us even more.,,,
2925,Claire , Mm...,,,
2926,Phil ," Okay, forget that. Go back one.",,,
2927,Alex ," Hey, guys. It was me.",,,
2928,Claire , What?,,,
2929,Phil , What?,,,
2930,Alex ," I found a cigarette at school, And when no one was home, I...I tried it, And... I-I guess I held it too close to the couch. I'm so sorry. You can take my Christmas away, But don't take I from everyone else.",,,
2931,Phil ," That is very noble of you to care about the family, but you still smoked and lied. That's really bad. Now help me grab the tree. ",,,
2932,Claire ," Phil, Phil. Alex, come on back. Starting December 26th, you are grounded for a full week, and that includes New Year's eve.",,,
2933,Alex , But I was g...,,,
2934,Claire ," no, nonnegotiable, so...",,,
2935,Phil, Mm.,,,
2936,Claire , Yeah.,,,
2937,Alex , Fine.,,,
2938,Phil , Everybody! It's official! Christmas is back on!,,,
2939,Luke , It is? What happened?,,,
2940,Phil ," Doesn't matter! Stockings, lights, ornaments, wreath! Go, go, go!",,,
2941,Luke , Okay!,,,
2942,Cameron ," Um, that sounds like a stressful job to me.",,,
2943,Santa/Scott ," Mm, not as much as you'd think. They always made sure one of us had a blank so nobody knew who took the fatal shot. This was mighty tasty. Well, I don't want to overstay my welcome Or you won't have me back. You guys enjoy the rest of your night. You're good people.",,,
2944,Mitchell ," Scott, wait. Wait. Don't forget your laundry.",,,
2945,Santa/Scott ," Oh, thanks. Thanks, thanks, thanks. Merry Christmas.",,,
2946,Cameron ," Scott, merry Christmas to... to you, too, and happy... Son of a bitch!",,,
2947,Santa/Scott , What?,,,
2948,Mitchell ," Oh, it's the new Greensleevers. They're Cameron's old caroling group. They kicked him out this year.",,,
2949,Cameron ," I mean, it is one thing to kick me out of the group, but to... to rub my nose in it? I'm turning on the sprinklers.",,,
2950,Santa/Scott ," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know it feels good to get even, believe me, to see the fear in a man's eyes is... But there's something that feels even better... forgiveness.",,,
2951,Cameron ," Scott, you don't understand. This... this group was my ""Dreamgirls."" I was Effie. ",,,
2952,Santa/Scott , Do you know what the best thing I did all day was? Forgiving you for getting me fired.,,,
2953,Cameron , Andrew. Ensemble. I know it's no accident that you're here on my street tonight. And I... I just wanted to say to you all that you sound great. And...Merry Christmas.,,,
2954,Andrew , Wow. Even your apology is off-key.,,,
2955,Santa/Scott ," Not cool, buddy.",,,
2956,Everyone , Ooh! Ooh!,,,
2957,Cameron , But... but... but what about... what about forgiveness?,,,
2958,Santa/Scott , You were nice. He was naughty.,,,
2959,Gloria , Where were you for so long?,,,
2960,Jay , Just a little last-minute shopping. What's this?,,,
2961,Manny , Buñuelos.,,,
2962,Jay , Who? What?,,,
2963,Gloria , Cheese fritters. It's a Colombian traditional Christmas food.,,,
2964,Jay ,," from now on, we do Colombian things when we're in Colombia. We do American things when we're in America. That means no more of your food, no more of your music, And especially no more of your crazy holidays! Inocente!",,
2965,Gloria , Jay!,,,
2966,Jay ," What? Did I say it wrong? You two are total inocentes. You should see the look on your faces. And by the way, you know how hard it is to get fireworks on Christmas eve?",,,
2967,Gloria ," Go, Manny. Thank you.",,,
2968,Phil , And here's another one for Luke. Looks like a book.,,,
2969,Luke , I have a book already.,,,
2970,Claire ," What is that? Oh, my God, the couch is smoking.",,,
2971,Phil , Whoa.,,,
2972,Luke , Whoa.,,,
2973,Phil , It's sunlight.,,,
2974,Alex , It's the ornament.,,,
2975,Luke, Cool. It's like a magnifying glass. ,,,
2976,Haley ," Hey, how weird is that? It's burning a hole in the exact same spot that Alex was smoking in.",,,
2977,Claire ," Oh, Haley.",,,
2978,Phil ," Alex, why'd you take the blame?",,,
2979,Alex , I didn't want to lose Christmas.,,,
2980,Phil , That is so stinking beautiful. Get in here.,,,
2981,Luke , Bear hug!,,,
2982,Haley , You were going to take Christmas away for something that none of us did.,,,
2983,Phil ," Well, um...Christmas is about moving forward.",,,
2984,Alex , I've never heard that.,,,
2985,Claire ," Actually, honey, you did kind of shoot your mouth off.",,,
2986,Luke , You called us all liars.,,,
2987,Alex ," Yeah, you did, and then you took away the biggest holiday...",,,
2988,Phil , I don't know. Let's... let's not all get worked up. I made a mistake. I made a mistake. And people make mistakes. And they make up for those mistakes...,,,
2989,Claire , Mm-hmm,,,
2990,Phil , ... by taking their family to Italy!,,,
2991,Haley," Oh, my god!",,,
2992,Kids , Yeah!,,,
2993,Jay ," We talk a lot about tradition this time of year. But as much as we love our traditions, sometimes our best memories come from the times that are the most untraditional. We remember the year mom and dad went crazy. We remember the year Santa punched out the caroler. But for me, this was the year that the word ""tradition"" got a lot bigger.",,,
2994,Jay, There's Cam.,,,
2995,Manny , Aah!,,,
2996,Jay , Oh! You got me again.   Modern Family,,,
2997,Alex , What's the most irritating thing my parents say to me?,,,
2998,Manny ," ""That's too much cologne.""",,,
2999,Haley ," ""That's how girls end up dead.""",,,
3000,Luke ," ""Don't talk black to me.""",,,
3001,Manny ," ""It's inappropriate because she's your teacher.""",,,
3002,Luke ," How do you even talk black? Like, end words with ""izzle""?",,,
3003,Alex ," It's talk back, you idiot.",,,
3004,Luke , Oh.,,,
3005,Alex ," ""Act more like an adult."" What does ""act more like an adult"" even mean?",,,
3006,Phil , Look at you. You're soaked. That is so lame! You're the one who wanted to do it!,,,
3007,Claire , What are you two doing?,,,
3008,Phil , I picked up one of those water weasels. You hook it on the end of the hose and it flies around in the air.,,,
3009,Claire , Just...Like a weasel.,,,
3010,Phil ," Yeah, look at how awesome. He's so wet.",,,
3011,Luke , I put the weasel in my pants.,,,
3012,Phil , He totally did!,,,
3013,Haley , Dork. Is there a reason why my window is wet?,,,
3014,Phil ," Hmm, very difficult to say. Um, I don't know. Up to... ow. Ow!",,,
3015,Claire ," What's wrong? Sweetie, are you okay?",,,
3016,Phil , A little... a little twinge. Yeah.,,,
3017,Haley , I'll call 911.,,,
3018,Alex , Maybe the firemen will come.,,,
3019,Phil ," No, no! No. No. No!",,,
3020,Alex , Give me it!,,,
3021,Phil , The firemen in our town have a reputation for being...Hot. Do I resent that? Of course not. These guys are my friends. I play  basketball with them. I bake for them. My question is... what's hot?,,,
3022,Jay, Come on! Let's go! Let's go!,,,
3023,Gloria ," We're coming. Manny, it's inappropriate because she's your teacher.",,,
3024,Manny ," What's the big deal, anyway?",,,
3025,Jay ," It's a surprise, you'll see.",,,
3026,Manny ," Oh, my god!",,,
3027,Gloria ," Jay, you didn't!",,,
3028,Jay ," Yes, I did. I got us into that new Benihana.",,,
3029,Gloria , Huh?,,,
3030,Jay , They got a chef there that can flip a shrimp into his own hat. What the hell?,,,
3031,Manny , Dad!,,,
3032,Javier , There's my boy!,,,
3033,Jay , What the hell is he doing here?,,,
3034,Gloria , Jay.,,,
3035,Jay ," No, he was supposed to pick up Manny yesterday and disappointed him again, as usual. Now he just sails in here out of the blue? I don't like the guy. Do I have reasons? Yeah. Good reasons? Yeah. How many reasons do I need? None. I don't like the guy. [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
3036,Javier ," So, I would have called, but while I was buying this boat for a friend, I got chased out to sea by another boat.",,,
3037,Manny , Were they pirates?,,,
3038,Javier , I didn't stop to ask.,,,
3039,Jay , It's not hard to tell. Did they have curvy swords and sing songs about how fun it is to be a pirate?,,,
3040,Javier ," Wow Jay, such a beautiful house, huh?",,,
3041,Jay ," So, we were just headed out to dinner.",,,
3042,Javier ," What, you think I show up empty-handed? I brought dinner... lobsters!",,,
3043,Manny , Did you catch them with your bare hands! ,,,
3044,Javier ," No, but I bought them with my bare hands.",,,
3045,Manny , Wow!,,,
3046,Javier ," And I have some nice wine, a good Cuban cigar for Jay. Hey, why don't you take a picture of him with your new camera phone?",,,
3047,Manny , I don't have a camera phone.,,,
3048,Javier , You do now.,,,
3049,Manny ," Awesome! All this excitement, my heart is just going.",,,
3050,Javier ," Now, listen to me, you bring that with you when you come to visit me this summer. We'll go in a race car with my friend, And after that, maybe a bullfight. I know all these guys, the matadors... They are like artists.",,,
3051,Jay , You're quite the bullfight artist yourself.,,,
3052,Gloria ," Uh...Manny, Why don't you show your father to the kitchen?",,,
3053,Javier ," Por favor, dios mio. Someone put on some music. Tonight, we dance.",,,
3054,Jay ," Oh, we're gonna dance. What did he say? Does he need money for the lobsters?",,,
3055,Gloria ," Jay, be nice.",,,
3056,Jay ," ""be nice""? I could be sitting grill-side watching a guy build an onion volcano. Instead, I got Rico Suave in my kitchen and I got a stolen boat in my driveway.",,,
3057,Gloria ," If it was for me, he'll be out of my life. But it's good for Manny to be with his father.",,,
3058,Jay , I just can't believe you ever fell for that act.,,,
3059,Gloria , Colombians can be very persuasive. They can make you agree to things before you even know it.,,,
3060,Jay , You must have been pretty naive.,,,
3061,Gloria ," Yeah, but now I'm with the right man, okay?",,,
3062,Jay , Right.,,,
3063,Gloria , Javier is only going to stay one night.,,,
3064,Jay , Good. Wait. What?,,,
3065,Cameron , Don't be mad. I just got up to change her. ,,,
3066,Cameron ," Well, Mitchell really wanted to ferberize the baby.",,,
3067,Mitchell ," Ferberize... it is a method Of getting the baby to sleep through the night By, yes, basically letting her cry herself to sleep.",,,
3068,Cameron , Torture.,,,
3069,Mitchell ," It's not torture, Cam.",,,
3070,Cameron , It's just hard if you happen to be a person who hates to hear another person suffer.,,,
3071,Mitchell , Or two people suffer.,,,
3072,Mitchell ," No, no, you got up to comfort her, Which only teaches her that every time she cries her daddy will come in and cuddle her and put on her favorite... What are we watching?",,,
3073,Cameron ," Brian de Palma's controversial masterpiece ""Scarface.""",,,
3074,Mitchell , For the baby?,,,
3075,Cameron ," She happens to like it. I don't know if it's the colors or the... the sounds. Oh, here comes the nightclub massacre. She loves it. Watch her little eyelids. It's so cute. They get so heavy.",,,
3076,Phil , Oh! That's bad!,,,
3077,Claire ," Oh, honey.",,,
3078,Phil ," I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm just... okay, that's cancer!",,,
3079,Claire , Maybe it's just a kidney stone.,,,
3080,Phil ," ""just,"" Claire?",,,
3081,Alex ," What's going on, guys?",,,
3082,Phil , It's nothing. Go back to bed.,,,
3083,Haley ," No, but, dad...",,,
3084,Phil , Don't touch me.,,,
3085,Claire , I bet it's just a kidney stone.,,,
3086,Phil ," ""just"" again! Someone get yo mom a glass of water and a piece of gravel from the driveway and see how she likes it.",,,
3087,Luke , Why is everybody yelling?,,,
3088,Alex , Something's wrong with dad.,,,
3089,Phil , Don't frighten him. Come here. Oh! That's got to be death! Death is coming!,,,
3090,Haley ," Okay, you need to go to the hospital, dad. Yeah. ",,,
3091,Phil ," No, no, no. I just need a pill. Get me the biggest one you can find.",,,
3092,Claire ," Honey, breathe. Just... just breathe.",,,
3093,Phil , That's what I told you when you were in labor and you threw my smoothie at me. Pill!,,,
3094,Haley ," Okay, I'm calling.",,,
3095,Phil ," No, no! It's fine. It's actually... it's fine. It's passing. It's passing. I'm sorry to alarm everyone. I think I was probably just overreacting because there's an alien inside of me! Oh, close it down.",,,
3096,Claire ," Oh, I'm definitely gonna call.",,,
3097,Phil , All systems down. All systems down.,,,
3098,Jay , Son of a bitch.,,,
3099,Gloria , What's the matter?,,,
3100,Jay ," He's playing on my pool table, that's what. Probably got himself a nice drink, too.",,,
3101,Gloria ," Where are you going, Jay?",,,
3102,Jay ," Just to check things out, okay?",,,
3103,Gloria , Come on.,,,
3104,Jay , You hear that? Now he's messing around with my remote control.,,,
3105,Gloria , You can't hear that from here.,,,
3106,Jay ," Hey, there.",,,
3107,Javier ," Hey, Jay, listen, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?",,,
3108,Jay ," No, no. I'm a light sleeper. That's what happens when you get older.",,,
3109,Javier , You're not old.,,,
3110,Jay , I didn't say I was old.,,,
3111,Javier ," I never sleep much, anyway. Life is just more interesting",,,
3112,after 2,"00 a.M. You know, the liquor tastes better. The, uh... the women are more beautiful. What is it they say? That the night belongs to the poets and the madmen.",,,
3113,Jay , Which are you? ,,,
3114,Javier ," Perhaps both. But I think maybe you, too, huh? I see a picture over here of you on a motorcycle. You ride?",,,
3115,Jay , I used to.,,,
3116,Javier ," ""used to""? ""used to""?! Jay, the saddest words in any language, my friend.",,,
3117,Jay ," Yeah. Hey, help me out here. Everybody sees you as this great guy. You know, you live this life of adventure. How come I don't buy a word of it? All I see is a dad who doesn't show up.",,,
3118,Javier ," Hey, Manny knows me. I live in the now.",,,
3119,Jay ," Well, I was living in the yesterday When Manny was crying outside that door 'cause you didn't show up for the tenth time.",,,
3120,Javier ," And when I don't come, you think, what, I'm just off chasing a good time, hmm? You ever think it might be hard for me, coming here?",,,
3121,Jay , Why? Because of Gloria?,,,
3122,Javier , Because of you.,,,
3123,Mitchell , Cam.,,,
3124,Claire ," Okay, they're on their way.",,,
3125,Phil ," Okay. Kids, gather around like you're hugging me, but don't touch me, okay? Now, look, I'm gonna be fine.",,,
3126,Alex ," We know, dad. We don't know that.",,,

3128,Alex ," Thanks, dad.",,,
3129,Haley ," I love you. Don't cry, Luke. I'm okay.",,,

3177,Javier ," Oh, listen, Jay, you're a tough guy to compete with. I mean, look at all you have.",,,
3178,Jay , So Manny has to suffer?,,,
3179,Javier ," No, you're right. Look, I'm going to try harder. But, you know, maybe it's a good thing that he has the two of us. From you, he learns stability. From me, he learns how to be spontaneous... Grab life by the throat.",,,
3180,Jay ," Well, we do a little throat-grabbing ourselves around here, you know? We were on our way to Benihana when you showed up. ",,,
3181,Mitchell ," Out! I thought you were... those were pillows. Come on. Come on. Cameron, do you realize how infuriating this is? The whole point of ferberizing is to teach her to put herself to sleep and you keep ruining it.",,,
3182,Cameron ," I can't help it. I'm like a mother bear. When I hear my cub crying, I have to run to her.  ",,,
3183,Mitchell ," Except you're not a bear. Get in our room. Get. Cam, get in there. Get in there. Cut it out. All the way. Our room. Get. Get in there. Come on. Come on. Get in there. Get!",,,
3184,Haley , That's so unfair. Why not?,,,
3185,Claire ," Because that's how girls end up dead. Hey, honey.",,,
3186,Phil ," Hey, guys. We just wanted to see how you were doing.",,,
3187,Claire , Is this a bad time?,,,
3188,Nurse ," No, we're just giving him something to relax before the procedure.",,,
3189,Phil , Which is gonna go just fine.,,,
3190,Alex ," Oh, we know.",,,
3191,Phil ," We don't know. In case it doesn't, promise me you'll be nice to your new fireman daddy.",,,
3192,Claire , Unbelievable.,,,
3193,Phil , My wife got dressed up for the firemen last night.,,,
3194,Claire , I didn't get dressed up for the firemen.,,,
3195,Alex , Those heels were really high.,,,
3196,Phil , You put on heels?,,,
3197,Claire , Let's drop it.,,,
3198,Luke ," What are they doing to you, dad?",,,
3199,Phil ," I have a little, scratchy rock inside of me, And they're sliding in a tube and sucking it out.",,,
3200,Luke ," You're not scared, are you?",,,
3201,Phil , When was the last time you saw your old man scared?,,,
3202,Luke , When you walked through the spider web. When we were playing with the ouija board and the wind blew the door shut.,,,
3203,Phil ," There was no wind, buddy. We brought something forth. This stuff's really hitting me. My insides feel like velvet.",,,
3204,Claire ," Why don't you guys wait out in the hallway, okay?",,,
3205,Luke ," Feel better, dad.",,,
3206,Phil , I will.,,,
3207,Alex ," Love you, dad.",,,
3208,Phil , Love you.,,,
3209,Haley , Love you. ,,,
3210,Phil ," Luke, buddy, hold back a sec. It's not gonna happen, okay, But there is a scenario where you could be the man of the house and you need to know all the pin numbers and passwords.",,,
3211,Luke , I don't want to be the man of the house.,,,
3212,Phil ," Now, don't talk black to me.",,,
3213,Claire ," Honey, your dad's gonna be fine. Why don't you wait out in the hall? I'll be right out, okay? Honey, I'm just gonna run them to school. I'll be back right after. Okay.",,,
3214,Phil , Claire?,,,
3215,Claire , Yeah?,,,
3216,Phil ," You did get dressed up, didn't you?",,,
3217,Claire , I pulled on the first thing I saw.,,,
3218,Phil ," Okay, okay, okay. Okay. I'll drop it. 'cause this stuff is making me fall asleep... Mm-hmm....And if I never wake up, I'd hate for the last thing you ever said to me to be a lie.",,,
3219,Claire , I might have gotten dressed up just a tiny bit.,,,
3220,Phil , I knew it.,,,
3221,Claire ," Oh, damn it.",,,
3222,Gloria ," Manny, we are gonna be late for school. Why are you so tired today?",,,
3223,Jay , Any reason I can't take him?,,,
3224,Gloria , I'm surprised you're up. I know what time you went back to bed.,,,
3225,Jay ," Oh, it was nothing. We just went out, we hit a few balls, And you'll never guess where... I guess Javier knew a guy",,,
3226,Gloria ," And you know what? Now that he knows you, the next time he needs something, You are the guy. Idios mio! Did you take him with you?",,,
3227,Jay , You couldn't wait to get to school to do that?,,,
3228,Gloria ," Manny, va monos para el colegio. Let's go. We're gonna be so late. Vamos! Vamos a llegar tardasimo, Manny. ¿que te pasa? Get in the car.",,,
3229,Jay , I thought you said you wanted me to bond with Javier.,,,
3230,Gloria ," I said be nice, Jay. I didn't say take Manny out all night and play games. ",,,
3231,Manny , Then we got hot dogs.,,,
3232,Gloria ," Go to sleep! If I wanted to be married to a wild man, I would have stayed with Javier.",,,
3233,Javier, Aha! ¿que pasa?,,,
3234,Manny , Dad!,,,
3235,Gloria ," Por Dio, no.",,,
3236,Jay, What the hell?,,,
3237,Javier ," Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. You're not leaving, are you?",,,
3238,Manny , I've got school.,,,
3239,Javier , What? School.,,,
3240,Gloria ," Yes, school. That's where people go to learn things, Like not to keep children up all night!",,,
3241,Javier , He told her?,,,
3242,Jay , He's weak.,,,
3243,Javier ," Well, listen, you said you used to like riding motorcycles, right? So I brought you one.",,,
3244,Jay ," I know, but I kind of got work.",,,
3245,Javier , Work.,,,
3246,Manny ," Go, Jay.",,,
3247,Javier ," Yeah, go, Jay.",,,
3248,Gloria," Yes, go, Jay, And take Manny with you, too!",,,
3249,Manny , Okay!,,,
3250,Gloria ," No, Manuel Alberto, in the car, Or I put you in the trunk! Jay, I'm not gonna argue anymore. I'm not gonna say anything else. Do whatever you want. But I don't want to hear you any more saying that Colombians are crazy, because you're the one that is acting crazy, Even though he's the one that is making you act crazy, So I don't know what the hell I'm talking about! Manny!",,,
3251,Cameron , You didn't need to come home during naptime.,,,
3252,Mitchell ," Mm, I think we proved last night that I did.",,,
3253,Cameron ," Well, she's back there now, So why don't you go so you don't get in trouble?",,,
3254,Mitchell , That's okay. I told everyone that I have an unreliable partner and they understood. ,,,
3255,Cameron ," Okay, you know what? I don't need to sit here and be condescended to. I'm gonna make myself an ice tea.",,,
3256,Mitchell , I will bring you down.,,,
3257,Cameron , You can't bring me down.,,,
3258,Mitchell , I'll sweep your legs.,,,
3259,Cameron , There's something wrong with you that the sound of our child in such distress doesn't bother you more.,,,
3260,Mitchell ," She is not in distress, And this just proves that you need this more than she does. I'm ferberizing two babies.",,,
3261,Cameron , Raccoons slipped into the Lawsons' home and stole a loaf of bread.,,,
3262,Mitchell , Your point?,,,
3263,Cameron ," That we left Lily's window open a crack and those raccoons need something to put between that bread... and that is Lily's ""help me"" cry. I'm coming for you, Lily.",,,
3264,Mitchell , You will not. You're not com... Cameron.,,,
3265,Cameron ," Let me go. Hey, stop! Let... let... Let go! Get off me! What are you doing?",,,
3266,Mitchell , Stop it! Slow down!,,,
3267,Cameron , I will not slow down. Ow!,,,
3268,Mitchell , Stop being such a baby!,,,
3269,Cameron , I'm coming for you!,,,

3272,Mitchell ," Oh, my ankle.",,,
3273,Cameron ," Oh, what?",,,
3274,Mitchell , My ankle.,,,
3275,Gloria ," Oh, I guess you didn't kill yourself in the motorcycle today.",,,
3276,Jay ," Well, I figured you were looking forward to killing me, So I'm not gonna take that away from you. Hey, did Javier call you?",,,
3277,Gloria ," No, why?",,,
3278,Jay , He's dragging me to this bar With some of his old baseball,,,
3279,pals. He was supposed to be here at 5,00.,,,
3280,Gloria ," Ah, he's dragging you, huh? ",,,
3281,Jay ," Yeah, I figured it would be okay. I mean, I've seen half these guys play, And Javier says it's cool. What? What's the joke?",,,
3282,Gloria ," Nothing. It's just funny to me that you make fun of me because I was seduced by him, and here you are...",,,
3283,Jay , No one is getting seduced. I'm doing this for Manny.,,,
3284,Gloria ," Oh, yeah, it's very important for Manny that you two go and have a nice picnic in the mountains.",,,
3285,Jay ," First of all, it wasn't a picnic. We stopped for coffee. They just happened to be selling crepes. Just let me know when he calls, all",,,
3286,"right? Geez, it's almost 6",00.,,,
3287,Claire , The kids are so excited for you to come home.,,,
3288,Phil ," Oh, me too.",,,
3289,Claire ," Yeah, Luke made you a sign.",,,
3290,Phil ," Oh, he's a sweetie.",,,
3291,Claire , Yeah. You seem great.,,,
3292,Phil , I am great.,,,
3293,Claire , Good.,,,
3294,Phil , Except for that firemen thing.,,,
3295,Claire , You remember it.,,,
3296,Phil , Mm-hmm.,,,
3297,Claire ," Yeah, okay. Look, I am sorry. I'm so sorry.",,,
3298,Phil ," Ah, no.",,,
3299,Claire ," Sorry. There's no excuse for it. I-I think I just spend so much time in dowdy mom clothes, And I'm covered in paste and peanut butter, And I just... I wanted to feel attractive for a second, you know? I'm sorry. I really...",,,
3300,Phil ," Honey, I just... just need a little bit of time. Gonna be fine.",,,
3301,Claire , Okay.,,,
3302,Phil , Yeah.,,,
3303,Claire , Okay.,,,
3304,Phil ," I was already fine with it. Here's the deal... Claire messed up. She owed me. This never happens. Old Phil has a golden ticket. Now, I could have cashed that in right away for something small... Get out of cleaning the garage, a week at circus camp. ",,,
3305,Phil ," Oh, still fresh.",,,
3306,Claire , Yeah.,,,
3307,Phil ," But the longer you hold onto it, the more the guilt builds, the more you get. Five years... trip to Paris with my buddies. 10 years... sweet, little convertible. 20 years... Hello, fully articulating, five-function robot that can read my mind and has feelings.",,,
3308,Elaine ," Phil, you're not leaving without saying goodbye, are you?",,,
3309,Phil ," Hey, Elaine.",,,
3310,Elaine , Is this your husband?,,,
3311,Claire , Uh-huh.,,,
3312,Phil , Goodbye Paris.,,,
3313,Elaine ," I'm visiting my sister, And he was entertaining us all afternoon with his card tricks.",,,
3314,Claire , Oh.,,,
3315,Elaine’s sister , Is that Phil? Hey.,,,
3316,Elaine ," Hey, mom, Phil's leaving.",,,
3317,Elaine’s mother , Without a hug?,,,
3318,Claire , Wow.,,,

3320,Elaine’s mother ," Brittany, hurry, honey. Phil's leaving.",,,
3321,Phil , Ow.,,,
3322,Claire , You're fine.,,,
3323,Cameron , How's your ankle?,,,
3324,Mitchell , It's cold.,,,
3325,Cameron , I'm sorry I hurt you.,,,
3326,Mitchell ," No, no, don't be. I'm... I could have just as easily hurt you. ",,,
3327,Cameron ," Well, it's cute that you think that.",,,
3328,Mitchell ," Listen, Cam, I-I can't always be the bad cop here. I know it's my issue, But she can't grow up with one huggy, happy, cuddly dad and one frowny, lesson-teachy dad. Because guess which one she's gonna ask to walk her down the aisle.",,,
3329,Cameron ," O... y... Okay, you know what? I can be the bad cop sometimes. I'll always make her eat her vegetables.",,,
3330,Mitchell , Okay. Dentist.,,,
3331,Cameron , Deal.,,,
3332,Mitchell , Good.,,,
3333,Cameron , As long as you make her practice her violin.,,,
3334,Mitchell ," Oh, yeah, the violin. I like that.",,,
3335,Cameron , And we're both walking her down the aisle. Assuming you can walk by then.,,,
3336,Mitchell , Ow!,,,
3337,Cameron , Do you need to go to the hospital for that?,,,
3338,Mitchell ," No, god, no. No, it's not that bad. Oh, you meant call 911, didn't you?",,,
3339,Mitchell & Cameron , Firemen.,,,
3340,Mitchell ," Yeah, you call and I'm gonna go change my shirt. ",,,
3341,Cameron ," No, uh... no, it's, it's not.",,,
3342,Phil , The hardest part is when people forget their card Because then I look like the idiot.,,,
3343,Phil ," All right, let's do it again.",,,
3344,Cameron , We really have to go.,,,
3345,Phil , You think I like this?,,,
3346,Cameron ," I'm sorry. Here. I'm gonna teach you one, okay?",,,
3347,Phil ," Oh, my...",,,
3348,Cameron ," On the count of three, just grab this. You ready? Put your hand out.",,,
3349,Phil , Okay.,,,
3350,Cameron ," 1, 2, 3. There it is.",,,
3351,Phil , No.,,,
3352,Mitchell , Wow.,,,
3353,Phil , What was that?,,,
3354,Mitchell , Thank you. ,,,
3355,Alex ," So, if I'm supposed to act like an adult, Is that act like adults I see in the world...",,,
3356,Luke , Water weasel!,,,
3357,Alex , ...Or the adults in my family? 'Cause if it's the ones in my family...,,,
3358,Manny , Come on. Let's go.,,,
3359,Jay , All right.,,,
3360,Alex , Then... How hard could that be?,,,
3361,Phil , Aah!,,,
3362,Phil , Really got me fired up about my magic again.,,,
3363,Phil , Is...This your card?,,,
3364,Cameron ," Yes. Oh, my gosh!",,,
3365,Phil ," It's... it's not, is it?  Modern Family",,,
3366,Phil ," Beautiful morning, isn't it? It's a shame you have to work, huh? Anyway, I would like a large sausage and pepperoni",,,
3367,Haley ," Hey, move.",,,
3368,Alex , It's my stuff! Okay?,,,
3369,Haley , Just keep your hands off my stuff!,,,
3370,Phil, Hey!,,,
3371,Alex , I didn't put my hands on your stuff!,,,
3372,Phil ," Hey! Just a second, Derek. What is the problem?",,,
3373,Haley , Alex read my journal.,,,
3374,Alex , I did not! Why would I even want to read your stupid journal?,,,
3375,Haley ," Because it contains the details of a life, And yo don't have one!",,,
3376,Alex, Ohh!,,,
3377,Phil ," Alex, don't read Haley's journal.",,,
3378,Alex, Uhh!,,,
3379,Phil , Sorry. My daughters. You got kids? Oh. What grade are you in?,,,
3380,Claire , Phil!,,,
3381,Phil ," Oh, that's my wife, Claire.",,,
3382,Claire , Luke was using my computer. For this.,,,
3383,Phil ," I'm gonna have to, uh, call you back.",,,
3384,Claire ," He told me he needed it to do homework, And then I find this... A-a picture of a topless woman, With the biggest boobs I have ever seen, Driving a tractor.",,,
3385,Phil ," Okay, um, uh, first of all, That's a combine, not a tractor.",,,
3386,Claire ," Phil! Phil, it is smut, and our 10-year-old is looking at smut! It's disgusting!",,,
3387,Phil ," Completely unacceptable.  woman dressed as a battleship. You know, the... you get... yeah. And then one of the transformers. And then it... it... Anyway, I had every intention of telling Claire. I just wanted her to calm down first.",,,
3388,Phil , Where are you going?,,,
3389,Claire , I'm going to pick up Luke from his sleepover. We need to talk to him about this now.,,,
3390,Phil ," Claire, this is a very delicate situation. If we don't handle it right, Luke might end up having an unhealthy attitude about sex. Or agribusiness. We'll talk about it when he gets home.",,,
3391,Claire ," Okay. Fine. But I am telling him that every time he looks at porn, God kills a puppy.",,,
3392,Phil , Maybe I should be the one to talk to him.,,,
3393,Gloria ," I am a very lucky woman. I have a wonderful family, a beautiful home. There's nothing that I would change. I hate the dog butler. I keep forgetting it's there, And every time it happens, it scares me all over again. Sometimes, at night, I think it's the devil. El diablo.",,,
3394,Jay ," Barkley? He's hilarious. I was in Vegas last month, and I was winning... ...And I thought, I could do the usual... Be a chump, give the money back to the casino... Or I could do something smart and buy something for myself at the casino store. He's already a family favorite.",,,
3395,Jay , Rub his chin a little under there. He likes that. There you go. Beautiful. There you go.,,,
3396,Jay ," He's a dog and a butler. I mean, who couldn't love him?",,,
3397,Gloria , Stupid dog. ,,,
3398,Phil ," Here's the thing... that was my picture. Well, not really mine. There's this guy at work who sends out these links. Does... doesn't matter who. Gil Thorpe. He sent out another one Of the same  [OPENING CREDITS] ",,,
3399,Cameron ," Okay, ready to go.",,,
3400,Mitchell ," Oh, make sure you pee first.",,,
3401,Cameron ," What am I, 7 years old?",,,
3402,Mitchell ," No, you do not want to go during the show. The marionettes stop what they're doing, March to the edge of the stage, and point at you.",,,
3403,Cameron ," Okay, that sounds terrifying.",,,
3404,Mitchell , It's really funny.,,,
3405,Mitchell ," Oh, one of my favorite childhood memories Was attending the moscow marionette theater.",,,
3406,Cameron ," I grew up one mile away from Missouri's largest water slide, and third-largest in the country.",,,
3407,Mitchell ," Oh, really? Cam, you never mentioned that before.",,,
3408,Cameron , You feel...,,,
3409,Mitchell , ...Feel like a torpedo.,,,
3410,Mitchell ," Hey, Cam, does the gardener usually work on Saturdays?",,,
3411,Cameron ," I don't know. He comes when we need him. He's like batman, but straight. Is he crying?",,,
3412,Mitchell ," Oh, yeah. We should probably... Probably go out the back, huh?",,,
3413,Cameron , He's clearly in pain. How can you just turn your back on a friend like that?,,,
3414,Mitchell , A friend? Really? Yeah. W-what's his name?,,,
3415,Cameron , Cesar sal...Azar.,,,
3416,Mitchell ," You made that up. You were gonna say ""caesar salad.""",,,
3417,Cameron , Was not.,,,
3418,Mitchell ," Cam. Come on. Really? ugh. All right, don't worry, Lily. I'm sure we'll get to the show on time. I'm sure dad is just gonna go out and give an encouraging word to the gardener, Hopefully mention the snail problem, And then we are gonna be... No. No, no. Cam, no. Hello.",,,
3419,Cameron , I don't think he speaks English. ,,,
3420,Mitchell ," Okay, this might be a good time to mention to you that the marionettes are not kind to latecomers. They bend over and show their bloomers.",,,
3421,Cameron ," Okay, I speak a little Spanish. ¿señor, te gustaría hacer el agua y tenemos nuestra cama?",,,
3422,Cesar , Gracias.,,,
3423,Mitchell , What was that?,,,
3424,Cameron ," I just asked him if he wanted to have a glass of water and sit down for a minute, Like any kind person would.",,,
3425,Claire , I didn't find any more porn.,,,
3426,Phil , That was hardly porn. It was a topless woman on a tractor. You know what they call that in Europe? A cereal commercial.,,,
3427,Claire , I should go talk to him.,,,
3428,Phil ," Honey, honey, honey, I got this! I got this! No, no, no, no, no. I-I got this. I got this. I was his age once. Breasts are like these scary mystical things that he's drawn to, like Frodo to Mordor.",,,
3429,Claire ," Okay, I'm definitely going to talk to him.",,,
3430,Phil ," No, no, no, no! Boys don't want their moms talking to them about sex any more than girls want their dads talking to them about periods, bras, and girdles and all that stuff.",,,
3431,Claire ," You do know that women stopped wearing girdles like 30 years ago, right?",,,
3432,Phil ," Honey, I know. I know. That... that is... that is exactly the kind of sexual revolution That our son is going through right now, So... Just... let's just... just trust it. Fix that step. Just know I will handle this, okay?",,,
3433,Gloria , Del Diablo!,,,
3434,Jay ," Hey, Gloria, do you have any idea why Barkley was in the guest room?",,,
3435,Gloria , I was just doing a little redecorating. Sometimes it's good to move things around just to see how they look.,,,
3436,Jay ," Yeah, but the guest room... that's crazy. He's not a guest. He works for us. Hey, give me a hand here, will you? I think his jacket  shifted while I was moving him. We can't have you untucked, our little butler. That doesn't make any sense, does it, boy?",,,
3437,Gloria , ay!,,,
3438,Jay ," ""ay""? What was that? Is he all right?",,,
3439,Gloria ," Ay, no. My bracelet got caught a little bit here.",,,
3440,Jay ," Well, don't panic.",,,
3441,Gloria , I'm not panicking.,,,
3442,Jay ," All right, try to relax. We can fix him. Let me take a better look. Come here, boy.",,,
3443,Phil , Luke?,,,
3444,Luke," Hey, dad. Hey, buddy.",,,
3445,Phil ," Um...Look, You and I need to have a little talk.",,,
3446,Luke , About what?,,,
3447,Phil ," Well, it's about computer stuff. Um... How do you make sure you've deleted something after you read it?",,,
3448,Gloria ," Sorry, Jay. It was an accident.",,,
3449,Jay ," You know, I'm beginning to think you don't like Barkley that much. I mean, first you hide him in the guest room, And now this.",,,
3450,Gloria , It's ridiculous! I didn't mean to hurt it!,,,
3451,Jay ," First of all, let's cut the ""its."" He is a he. And you can pretend to be innocent all you want, but action speaks louder than words.",,,
3452,Gloria , Yeah. They can be very revealing.,,,
3453,Jay , What are you trying to say?,,,
3454,Gloria ," Nothing, but you have to admit that the dog butler is a little ridiculous.",,,
3455,Jay , You know what else I think is ridiculous? That mountain of pillows you have on our bed. I feel like I'm working on a loading dock just trying to get under the covers.,,,
3456,Gloria , They're pretty.,,,
3457,Jay , They're a damn nuisance.,,,
3458,Gloria ," Okay, forgive me for trying to make our home beautiful.",,,
3459,Jay ," Well, you know, if I can put up with those, you can put up with a piece of art. ",,,
3460,Gloria ," This is not art. It's an unholy mix between man and beast. But fine. If you love it so much, put it wherever you want.",,,
3461,Jay ," Thank you. Where you going, to get some more pillows?",,,
3462,Gloria ," No, don't worry. It'll be a long time before I bother you again with my pillows.",,,
3463,Alex , Why is dad in Luke's room with the door closed?,,,
3464,Claire , They are having a little talk.,,,
3465,Alex , Is Luke being punished?,,,
3466,Claire ," Is that your favorite thing, When your brother or sister gets into trouble?",,,
3467,Alex ," My favorite is when they're both in trouble. So, what'd he do? Did he cheat on a test? He's a cheater.",,,
3468,Claire , He did not cheat on a test.,,,
3469,Alex, Did he lie?,,,
3470,Claire , Alex.,,,
3471,Alex , He lies all the time.,,,
3472,Claire , Alex.,,,
3473,Alex , Sorry. I'm... I'm just worried about Luke. A lot of parents are hitting again.,,,
3474,Claire ," I appreciate your concern, But your father has it under control.",,,
3475,Phil , 24. 25. Flincher! Free slap. Bring it up.,,,
3476,Luke , Ow!,,,
3477,Phil , 29.,,,
3478,Luke , Can be on the bottom now?,,,
3479,Phil , Yeah.,,,
3480,Claire , Mm. How'd it go?,,,
3481,Phil ," Well, he was really embarrassed, but everything's... everything's fine now.",,,
3482,Claire , What'd you say?,,,
3483,Phil ," Well, you know, I kind of promised him We'd keep everything between us. Mm-hmm. Matter of fact, He'd be mortified if you brought it up with him... Ever. ",,,
3484,Claire ," Oh, god. Really?",,,
3485,Phil , Yeah.,,,
3486,Claire , That actually makes me feel kind of bad.,,,
3487,Phil , Well... You're probably just feeling a little tense from all this. I know I am. You know what might help the situation?,,,
3488,Claire , Really? Right now?,,,
3489,Phil , I meant going out for a few pizzas. Where's your mind? I guess I live in a house full of sex maniacs.,,,
3490,Cameron , Amigo? We can't help you if you won't come out.,,,
3491,Cesar , Gracias por invitarme a su casa. Me averguenzo de mis lágrimas.,,,
3492,Mitchell , What'd he say?,,,
3493,Cameron , Something... House... Something.,,,
3494,Mitchell ," Oh, come on! The show starts in a half-hour, and we still have to pick up Manny. Can... can we just... Come on, move this thing along.",,,
3495,Cameron ," Okay, this man is in crisis. He could have a familyhealth issue or a personal-health issue or a financial matter.",,,
3496,Mitchell ," Okay, wait, stop. You're getting all this from ""something house something""? Let's just call Gloria and have her deal with it, okay?",,,
3497,Cameron ," ""it"" is a human being, Mitchell!",,,
3498,Mitchell , Named caesar salad.,,,
3499,Cameron ," Okay, what's going on with you?",,,
3500,Mitchell ," Cam, you... mnh! You always do this! It's like you're incapable of hearing anyone's sad story Without making it your job to fix it, And then my needs... my needs come second.",,,
3501,Cameron , Your needs right now are a puppet show. This man could have lost his brother in a cable-car accident!,,,
3502,Mitchell ," You understood ""casa.""",,,
3503,Cameron ," Okay, fine. If it'll prove to you that I'm not the obsessive help-aholic that you make me out to be, Let's go to the puppet show.",,,
3504,Mitchell , Cam...,,,
3505,Cameron , Let's go. ,,,
3506,Woman ," Ay, ¿dónde está mi novio? Su camión está aparcado fuera.",,,
3507,Cameron , I think this has something to do with the gardener.,,,
3508,Mitchell , You think?,,,
3509,Cameron ," Um, just down the hall to the right.",,,
3510,Woman ," Ay, gracias, gracias. Perdón.",,,
3511,Cameron , Okay. Let's go.,,,
3512,Mitchell ," Oh, no, please... I know it's killing you not to get back there in the middle of that.",,,
3513,Cameron ," Oh, no, no, no, no. We are going. These folks can find their own way out. And now you'll know that I'm not a manic mother Teresa out there collecting lost souls.",,,
3514,Mitchell ," Oh, come on!",,,
3515,Mitchell ," Dad, is Manny ready?",,,
3516,Jay , Didn't you get the message? He's not going.,,,
3517,Mitchell , What?,,,
3518,Jay ," Oh, some mandatory cleanup at school.",,,
3519,Mitchell , What's the real reason?,,,
3520,Jay ," It's a puppet show, Mitch.",,,
3521,Mitchell ," Perfect. All right, it's just you and me, then, Lily.",,,
3522,Jay , How's the little fortune cookie?,,,
3523,Mitchell ," Oh, she's... she's good. She's good.",,,
3524,Jay , Where's Cam?,,,
3525,Mitchell ," We got into a fight. Because of him, I have a house full of latinos.",,,
3526,Jay ," Welcome to my world. So, trouble in gay paradise, huh?",,,
3527,Mitchell ," Well, he just can't say no to anybody who needs help, And why do you have to always add the word ""gay"" where it doesn't belong?",,,
3528,Jay ," Hey, hey... you're not mad at me. You're mad at the old balls and chain.",,,
3529,Mitchell ," Okay, dad, good talk. See you later.",,,
3530,Jay ," Oh, come on. I didn't mean it. Hey, I didn't mean it. I'm a little cranky. I got into it with Gloria a little bit.",,,
3531,Mitchell ," Oh, no. What happened? ",,,
3532,Jay ," Ah, she hates Barkley. It's the same stuff I went over with your mom all the time... Get rid of the boat, Get rid of the motorcycle. You know, I liked those things.",,,
3533,Mitchell ," Why do you have to get rid of it, then?",,,
3534,Jay ," You know, actually, I don't. Anyway, I'm gluing his hand on over here. His hand came off.",,,
3535,Mitchell ," Rough day, dad. Your hot, young wife doesn't like your doll.",,,
3536,Jay ," yeah. Unlike your big problem... ""my boyfriend's too nice to people.""",,,
3537,Mitchell ," No, see... mm. That's not all it is. He... he helps animals. He's always volunteering for things. T-trust me, it - it - it's worse than it sounds.",,,
3538,Jay ," Who are we kidding? We both got it pretty good. Hell, I'm probably fighting with your mom more than I'm fighting with Gloria on this thing.",,,
3539,Mitchell ," A bird fell out of a tree, and he fed it with an eyedropper.",,,
3540,Jay ," Just drop it, kid. We're both with people different from us, And that's gonna create stuff, but you want different. Your mom and I were perfect on paper, And you know how that ended. What I got now is a lot better. Sure, people look at us sometimes, And sometimes even I can't believe we're together. But we're happy. At the end of the day, there's no one I'd rather come home to.",,,
3541,Mitchell , You mean Gloria?,,,
3542,Jay , Who else?,,,
3543,Mitchell , No one. I'll see you later.,,,
3544,Jay ," See you, kid.",,,
3545,Alex , Did you draw on my poster?,,,
3546,Haley ," Yeah, I did. Maybe you'll think about that the next time you read my journal.",,,
3547,Alex ," I didn't read your stupid journal, and I waited in line to get this signed, Haley.",,,
3548,Haley ," Oh, don't be such a baby. It's just some dude with weird hair. ",,,
3549,Alex ," That's Maya Angelou, you idiot.",,,
3550,Haley ," Ohh, sorry I don't follow the WNBA.",,,
3551,Alex ," You know what? This is the worst thing you've ever done, and I'll never forgive you!",,,
3552,Haley , You started it!,,,
3553,Alex , What are you looking at?,,,
3554,Luke ," Well, I just heard...",,,
3555,Luke ," I was the one who read Haley's diary. I was playing on her computer, and it just opened. Okay, I opened it. But I didn't mean for anyone to fight.",,,
3556,Cameron ," Oh. Home already. Mitchell, hi! Hi!",,,
3557,Mitchell ," Hi, Cam. Hi.",,,
3558,Cameron , Did you forget the tickets?,,,
3559,Mitchell ," No. You know, I was never gonna enjoy the show without you, so...",,,
3560,Cameron ," Oh, but you were so excited to take Lily to see the Russian marionettes.",,,
3561,Mitchell ," She's probably a little young anyways. We can just prop her in front of the dryer for a half-hour. Listen, Cam, I-I love that you try and help the world. And I-I'm very lucky to have you in my life.",,,
3562,Cameron ," Oh, Mitchell.",,,
3563,Mitchell , How'd everything work out with the gardener?,,,
3564,Cameron ," Uh, great. Great. Turned out it was his wedding day, And he was just a little nervous. But you know what? There's no need to apologize to me.",,,
3565,Mitchell ," No, I need to. I've been very selfish.",,,
3566,Cameron ," No, no. Sometimes I take things too far.",,,
3567,Mitchell ," Okay, well, if that ever happens, I will let you know.",,,
3568,Cameron , Okay.,,,
3569,Mitchell , Is there a reason I can't go inside?,,,
3570,Cameron ," No. No, no. No.",,,
3571,Priest , Y ahora te pronuncio hombre y esposa. La puedes besar. ,,,
3572,Luke ," Mom, can I talk to you?",,,
3573,Claire ," Sure, honey. What's going on?",,,
3574,Luke , I feel bad about something I did.,,,
3575,Claire ," Oh, sweetie. Is this about the computer?",,,
3576,Luke , Yeah.,,,
3577,Claire , Something you shouldn't have been looking at?,,,
3578,Luke , Yeah. It was just so freaky. I couldn't stop looking.,,,
3579,Claire ," I know, sweet pea, But the important thing is you did stop looking.",,,
3580,Luke , Yeah. After about an hour.,,,
3581,Claire ," Okay. Well, it's perfectly normal to be curious about these things.",,,
3582,Luke , Some parts were funny.,,,
3583,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
3584,Luke , And some parts just seemed crazy.,,,
3585,Claire ," Well, I hope you realize that some of those parts weren't real.",,,
3586,Luke ," Obviously. But they can be totally real, right?",,,
3587,Claire , Hmm.,,,
3588,Luke , Like Anne Frank's?,,,
3589,Claire , What?,,,
3590,Luke ," All I know is, it really made me wonder about Haley.",,,
3591,Claire ," That's disturbing, sweetie. Why Haley?",,,
3592,Luke , It was her journal.,,,
3593,Haley , You read my journal? You little creep!,,,
3594,Luke , I'm sorry! I couldn't help it!,,,
3595,Claire ," Wait, Haley's journal, too? Luke, you are now banned from the computer.",,,
3596,Luke , What?,,,
3597,Alex , What happened? Who's in trouble?,,,
3598,Haley , Luke read my journal!,,,
3599,Alex , I told you it wasn't me!,,,
3600,Haley , I'm gonna kill you!,,,
3601,Claire ," Haley, calm down.",,,
3602,Haley ," What, you're not even gonna yell at him? That was private! ",,,
3603,Claire ," Oh, please. The most shocking thing in there was your spelling.",,,
3604,Haley ," You read it, too?",,,
3605,Alex , Am I the only one who hasn't read it?,,,
3606,Claire , I was looking through the computers in the house for pornography.,,,
3607,Haley , Sick.,,,
3608,Claire , Not for me. I wanted to see what you guys are looking at.,,,
3609,Haley , So you're violating our privacy.,,,
3610,Claire ," When I find out that my children are looking at a naked picture online, They don't have any privacy.",,,
3611,Alex , Who was looking at naked pictures?,,,
3612,Claire , That doesn't matter.,,,
3613,Haley , I wasn't.,,,
3614,Luke , It wasn't me! That's gross! I'm 10!,,,
3615,Claire , Wait a minute.,,,
3616,Luke , What's wrong with you people?,,,
3617,Claire ," If it wasn't you, who was it?",,,
3618,Phil , Mangia!,,,
3619,Cameron ," Rosa, thank you for coming.",,,
3620,Rosa , Gracias.,,,
3621,Cameron ," Carlos, let me know how it works out with that dentist. Victor, you owe me a dance.",,,
3622,Cameron ," Yes, I'm a caring person, and without Mitchell, I would just keep giving and giving and giving. I'm like a big, runaway charity truck and Mitchell is my of f-ramp full of safety gravel. He knows how to say no. He always can put himself first. He certainly can turn his back on someone's suffering.",,,
3623,Mitchell ," Um... No, really, keep going.",,,
3624,Cameron , He...,,,
3625,Mitchell , Don't keep going!,,,
3626,Cameron , Gracias. Goodbye. That was nice.,,,
3627,Mitchell ," Oh, god! Dad. ",,,
3628,Jay ," Looks like I missed the party, huh?",,,
3629,Mitchell , What I... what is that doing here?,,,
3630,Jay , He is a gift for you and Cam.,,,
3631,Cameron , Thank you.,,,
3632,Jay , He lost his monocle on the drive. His head was out the window.,,,
3633,Cameron ," Well, they love that.",,,
3634,Jay , I'll just put him here for now.,,,
3635,Mitchell , I don't want that.,,,
3636,Cameron , I think he's cute. Let's give him a chance.,,,
3637,Gloria , I came as soon as I heard your message. Did you say that somebody was getting married?,,,
3638,Jay ," Gloria, there you are! I've got good news! What's the matter?",,,
3639,Phil , Honey? Hey. I'm really sorry. That picture was just something that someone sent me. Doesn't matter who. Gil Thorpe. Anyway... I don't do that stuff. You're all the porn I need.,,,
3640,Claire ," That's... Honey, it's fine. It's fine.",,,
3641,Phil , Aah!,,,
3642,Claire , Now it's fine.,,,
3643,Claire , I couldn't care less about the picture. I was just upset when I thought it was Luke.,,,
3644,Claire ," Haley, honey, I really wish you would give me a hand with all this laundry. Never, ever...",,,
3645,Claire ," Haley's off in her own world. Alex has never really been a kid. But Luke is my baby. Is it really too much to ask that he stay a sweet, innocent kid... Forever? ",,,
3646,Phil ," Well, it was a woman on a tractor, And she had her shirt off.",,,
3647,Luke , Was it hot?,,,
3648,Phil ," Okay, we're being honest here. Um... This particular woman... Well, my tastes do run to the curvy, and the cowboy hat did not hurt one bit. Couple that with the cut-off jeans... And you were asking about the weather, weren't you?",,,
3649,Luke , Yeah.,,,
3650,Phil ," Well, this is good. This is good. You're gonna be going through some changes soon, And I think now you can feel safe talking to me about whatever.",,,
3651,Butler ," Sadly, I've been summarily dismissed from the employ of masters Cameron and Mitchell... The former being an utter delight, and the latter being a humorless snoot.",,,
3652,Mitchell ," Just... come on, get him in the car. The thrift shop's closing.",,,
3653,Cmaeron , What is this exciting thrift shop you speak of? Many of my relatives were taken out of their homes to be released into the green pastures in their maturity!,,,
3654,Mitchell ," Did you just say ""maturity""?",,,
3655,Cameron ," Unhand me, you brute! I regret nothing! I'll pay you. I'm a comfortable man. I've been stealing from your father for days. Oh, is there any better feeling in the world than having your ears flap in the wind?",,,
3656,Mitchell , You know what? Get out.,,,
3657,Cameron ," You mean it? Sweet freedom No. No, not you, Barkley. Cameron. Out.",,,
3658,Cameron , Oh. ,,,
3659,Phil ," Hey, buddy. Um... Here, sorry. We'll... we'll dribble later. Um...I just, uh, I just want to say I'm sorry. I never meant to blame you for that whole picture thing. Your mom sort of thought it was yours, And I-I should have stopped it, but I didn't.",,,
3660,Luke , So what was the picture of?  Modern Family,,,
3661,Phil ," Can people change? Well, that's a... tough one that's a tough one but I would say ""yes"", people can change. That's what I believe, anyway. And I will until the day I die.",,,
3662,Claire , You do realize you're proving the exact opposite of your point?,,,
3663,Phil ," See, she's changed. She used to be very supportive about me.",,,
3664,Claire , Come on... Phil!,,,
3665,Phil , Ow! Why is this so loud?,,,
3666,Claire , Why is this so loud? Make it stop.,,,
3667,Phil ," I just installed a sweet home theater system at the family room. The trouble is... Claire struggles with technology. Of any kind. I mean, remotes, cell phones, computers...",,,
3668,Claire ," Haley, have you seen my blue...",,,
3669,Dylan ," Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.",,,
3670,Claire ," Oh, hey, Dylan.",,,
3671,Dylan ," You know I can see you, right?",,,
3672,Claire ," Oh, I did not know that.",,,
3673,Dylan ," Haley is just in the bathroom, she'll be back in just a minute?",,,
3674,Claire , Thank you.,,,
3675,Phil , What are we pointing at?,,,
3676,Claire , At the TV.,,,
3677,Phil ," Honey, no, I'm sorry. It's a home theater.",,,
3678,Claire , What so I - I can't point at the TV when I wanna watch the TV?,,,
3679,Phil , No. You point at the receiver.,,,
3680,Claire , What's a receiver? ,,,
3681,Phil ," Okay, imagine our home theater system is a human body, so, then, the receiver is the brain. The TV is the face.",,,
3682,Claire , I know what part you are...,,,
3683,Jay ," So, he says those lies, and a lot many more. His heart Boom! Quadruple bypass, blow the valve.",,,
3684,Cameron , Hey! Look who it is!,,,
3685,Jay ," Hey, there he is.",,,
3686,Cameron , What a coinkydink. I was just getting some flowers for Gloria for babysitting Lily.,,,
3687,Jay , You want me to take them to her?,,,
3688,Cameron ," I would, But I have the most hilarious card for her at home. It's... it's a hunky Antonio Banderas type in silk boxers, and on the inside it says, ""thank you for last noche... but I can't find my pantalones."" I'm not doing it justice, really. Hi, I'm Cameron.",,,
3689,Jay ," Oh, geez, I'm sorry. Guys, this is Cameron. He's a, um... a ffriend of my son's. This is, uh, Scotty, Dale, Hugo, and Shorty.",,,
3690,Cameron ," It's nice to meet you guys. You guys look like a scene out of ""Jersey boys.""",,,
3691,Gloria ," Ohh, so handsome!",,,
3692,Manny , Thank you.,,,
3693,Gloria ," Manny, are you wearing aftershave?",,,
3694,Manny , Yes. For my date. This will be the first time she will ever smell me.,,,
3695,Manny , Her name is Whitney. I met her in an online book club. We both like vampire fiction and the romance of eternal life.,,,
3696,Gloria ," I think it's adorable that Manny has a date. He even picked out the lunch menu. Grilled-cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Tomato soup because, you know that tomato soup is like the blood and the vampires like to eat their blood. and then he wants me to take them out for ice cream, Well, because Manny likes ice cream. ",,,
3697,Manny ," Oh, that must be her. If this goes well, you don't need to stick around.",,,
3698,Whitney ," Hi, I'm Whitney. I'm here for Manny. [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
3699,Mitchell ,, See how that works?,,
3700,Cameron ," Sorry, sweetie.",,,
3701,Mitchell ," Sorry, daddy. Oh, it's all right. We were just... me and Lily were just using the time to finally figure out how to use the car's voice-command thingy.",,,
3702,Cameron , Oh.,,,
3703,Mitchell ," Yeah, here, Check it out. Watch. Cd player, next track.",,,
3704,System’s voice , Say a command.,,,
3705,Mitchell ," Cd player, next track.",,,
3706,System’s voice , Air conditioner on.,,,
3707,Mitchell , Damn it.,,,
3708,Cameron ," Wow, you're worse than your sister with this kind of stuff. It's a good thing Lily doesn't have an ejector seat. Oh, guess what. I ran into your dad and some of his friends.",,,
3709,Mitchell ," Oh, really?",,,
3710,Cameron ," Yeah. And get this... He, uh, he referred to me as ""a friend of my son.""",,,
3711,Mitchell , Seriously?,,,
3712,Cameron ," Yeah. Well, I wasn't offended by it.",,,
3713,Mitchell ," Well, I am. I mean, w-would he refer to Phil as ""a friend of Claire's?"" no.",,,
3714,Cameron , I've heard him call Phil a lot worse. Just let it pass. I should have never said anything.,,,
3715,Mitchell ," No, I'm not letting it pass. He needs to know that that's not okay. And if he doesn't like it, he knows where he can go.",,,
3716,System’s voice , Enter a destination.,,,
3717,Mitchell , Hell!,,,
3718,System’s voice , Mexican food.,,,
3719,Mitchell , Shut up! ,,,
3720,Mitchell ," I came out of the closet in my mid-20s. I had to actually come out to my dad three times before he finally acknowledged it. I'm not sure if maybe he was hoping he heard it wrong. Like I had said, ""dad, I'm gray.""",,,
3721,Cameron ," And my parents, they always just knew. My mother says labor with me took 36 hours because I came out of the womb like this, ""hello!""",,,
3722,Mitchell ," Hey, dad.",,,
3723,Jay ," Mitchell. Hey, you guys know my son, Mitch.",,,
3724,Guys , Hey.,,,
3725,Shorty ," Hey, Mitch. How's it hanging there, buddy? That's a great coat. Where'd you get that?",,,
3726,Mitchell ," Um, you know, I don't know. It was a gift.",,,
3727,Shorty ," Really? What is it, suede? Microsuede? Some kind of lambskin? It's very soft, you know?",,,
3728,Mitchell ," Thank you. Uh, dad, can I talk to you for a second?",,,
3729,Jay ," Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be right back. Good seeing you. What's the matter?",,,
3730,Mitchell ," Um, ""a friend of my son""? That's how you introduce Cam?",,,
3731,Jay , That's why you came here?,,,
3732,Mitchell ," Dad, it's... it's just more than a little insulting. Cam and I have been together for five years. We... we have a daughter.",,,
3733,Jay ," It's... Look at these guys. They look like they came out of the 1800s. You see Hugo over there? After lunch, he ordered a sanka.",,,
3734,Mitchell ," No, they're... they're not the ones that are uncomfortable with this. You are. You... You've never been completely accepting of me and now that I have a family, it's getting a little old.",,,
3735,Jay , These guys don't understand the gay thing. Why create an awkward situation? That's all I'm saying.,,,
3736,Mitchell ," That's weird, because your friend Shorty there... Gay as they come.",,,
3737,Jay , You got to be kidding.,,,
3738,Mitchell ," Mnh, no. My gaydar is never wrong, And it is pinging like we're at a bathhouse. ",,,
3739,Jay ," What are you talking about, gay? The guy used to be married.",,,
3740,Mitchell ," Okay, well, that makes... no, well, so did Elton John, Merv Griffin, Cole Porter...",,,
3741,Jay ," Hey, you know what? You know what? Listen to me. You couldn't be more wrong about this.",,,
3742,Mitchell ," No, dad, you could not be more wrong... about a lot of things. Good seeing you guys.",,,
3743,Guys , Yeah! See you!,,,
3744,Shorty , That's a great coat!,,,
3745,Mitchell , Ping!,,,
3746,Phil , Phil Dunphy.,,,
3747,Claire ," Hey, it's me.",,,
3748,Phil , Hey!,,,
3749,Claire ," Listen, I've got a bunch of moms over here who want to watch the talent-show dvd, and I can't get the sound to work.",,,
3750,Phil , Is there a picture?,,,
3751,Claire , Yes.,,,
3752,Phil , Be honest. Did you do that thing where you get frustrated and you start pressing all the buttons?,,,
3753,Claire , No.,,,
3754,Claire ," I have a theory that Phil installs overly complicated things in the house just so he has an excuse to talk to me like a child. Last month, it was the thermostat.",,,
3755,Phil ," *The snowflake button makes it cold, cold, cold. Set temperature"" makes it hold, hold, hold, the little flame makes it... *",,,
3756,Whitney , This is so humiliating. I am sorry.,,,
3757,Manny , It's okay.,,,
3758,Whitney , He just seemed so mature online. How could I be so stupid?,,,
3759,Manny , You're not stupid. Stupid is not following your heart and taking a chance on love. ,,,
3760,Whitney ," I mean, what kind of 11-year-old talks like that?",,,
3761,Gloria , Manny's an old soul.,,,
3762,Manny ," Here, use my handkerchief.",,,
3763,Gloria , You see what I mean?,,,
3764,Whitney ," I'll just be alone for the rest of my life, and that's okay.",,,
3765,Gloria ," No, don't say that. In my country, there is a saying that means, ""love is just around the corner.""",,,
3766,Gloria , I come from a neighborhood with a lot of prostitutes.,,,
3767,Whitney ," Maybe for you. I mean, men must throw themselves at you every day.",,,
3768,Gloria , They'll do the same for you if you just...,,,
3769,Whitney , Just what? Put out?,,,
3770,Gloria ," No, just... like, the lipstick, the hair, push-up bra, you know.",,,
3771,Whitney , What's it matter? I'm never gonna be as pretty as you.,,,
3772,Gloria ," Believe me, this takes a lot of work. You just need to find your inner beauty.",,,
3773,Manny , It's hiding beneath a mask of insecurity.,,,
3774,Whitney ," Okay, he's starting to freak me out.",,,
3775,Gloria ," Manny, go play.",,,
3776,Manny , Okay.,,,
3777,Cameron ," Mitchell, how do these look to you?",,,
3778,Mitchell , Like they're dying.,,,
3779,Cameron ," I know, right? I said something to the florist, And he said, ""oh, don't worry about it. They're gonna me back."" they're not coming back. They've crossed to the other side!",,,
3780,Mitchell , You are a funny man.,,,
3781,Cameron , Why?,,,
3782,Mitchell ," Well, because you're completely bothered by the flowers, But when my father introduces you as ""a friend of my son""... Doesn't faze you in the least.",,,
3783,Cameron , Because the florist played me for a fool. Your dad didn't mean any harm. He's just being who he is. ,,,
3784,Mitchell ," Uh, when I was back east in law school, my dad used to",,,
3785,call me every Saturday at 6,"00 P.M. Before people would go out, Just, you know, check in, catch up. And then I think the Christmas of my second year, I finally got up the courage to tell him. After that, I-I pretty much just talked to my mom.",,,
3786,Cameron , Don't cry.,,,
3787,Mitchell , I'm not crying.,,,
3788,Jay , I'm home!,,,
3789,Gloria , We're here. This is Whitney. We're giving her a makeover.,,,
3790,Whitney , Hi. You have such a beautiful house.,,,
3791,Jay ," Thanks. Uh, you two know each other how?",,,
3792,Manny , She's my date.,,,
3793,Jay , Of course she is. I'll be in here.,,,
3794,Gloria , I'll be right back.,,,
3795,Manny , I'm sorry this didn't turn out like you wanted.,,,
3796,Whitney ," That's okay. Probably didn't turn out how you wanted it, either.",,,
3797,Manny ," I'll tell you what. If neither of us is with anybody in 10 years, how about you and me give it a shot?",,,
3798,Whitney , That's disturbing... but maybe.,,,
3799,Jay , How was your lunch with the boys?,,,
3800,Jay , Good. Ran into Mitchell and Cam.,,,
3801,Gloria ," Ay, nice.",,,
3802,Jay , And you're not gonna believe this. Mitchell says Shorty's gay.,,,
3803,Gloria ," Shorty? Yeah, I believe it.",,,
3804,Jay ," Oh, come on!",,,
3805,Gloria ," Well, he's a great dresser, a great dancer.",,,
3806,Jay , That doesn't prove anything.,,,
3807,Gloria , And he's the only one of your friends that never hits on me.,,,
3808,Jay , My friends hit on you?,,,
3809,Gloria ," Ah, yes, all the time. But don't worry... They're a bunch of harmless old men. ",,,
3810,Jay , They're my age.,,,
3811,Gloria ," I'm sure it's very hard on Shorty to keep a secret like that. Jay, I think you should talk to him.",,,
3812,Jay , What?,,,
3813,Gloria ," Yeah, you're the only one with a gay son. I'm sure he'll appreciate opening up to you.",,,
3814,Jay ," We're guys. We don't ""open up."" We talk about sports and cars, getting up in the middle of the night to pee.",,,
3815,Gloria , But I'm sure you made it very easy for Mitch to come out of the closet.,,,
3816,Jay , Yeah.,,,
3817,Gloria ," Okay, I'm gonna finish my makeover... 'cause I care about people... Because I want to help them change their lives. Jay, I'm hinting that you should call your friend, okay?",,,
3818,Jay ," Yes, I'm getting that.",,,
3819,Gloria ," Okay, okay.",,,
3820,Phil ," Hey, hey, hey. Daddy in the hiz-ouse!",,,
3821,Phil ," Why would you do that to a brand-new, very expensive remote?",,,
3822,Claire ," Because I lost my temper and it didn't work. Therefore, it's useless.",,,
3823,Phil ," Well, honey, when it comes to anything electronic, you're not exactly the best student.",,,
3824,Claire , I am very smart. I had a 4.0 in college. How about you?,,,
3825,Phil , I was almost that despite my substantial time commitment to cheerleading.,,,
3826,Claire , I thought we agreed not to bring up the cheerleading.,,,
3827,Phil ," Cheerleading in my college was cool. The football players were so jealous, they wouldn't even let me and my buddies Trevor, Scotty, and Ling go to their parties.",,,
3828,Phil ," Seriously, Claire, you owe me an apology for baking that. ",,,
3829,Claire ," Okay. Phil, I apologize for breaking the world's worst remote... That you bought... stupidly.",,,
3830,Phil ," Excuse me, But the experts at cnet.Com rated it the best remote. They gave it three-and-a-half mice.",,,
3831,Claire ," Wow! Well, I have an idea. Let's invite the gang from cnet over and your old buddies from cheerleading And we can have a nerd party.",,,
3832,Phil , Ling is not a nerd. He built his own helicopter. And if he was alive today...,,,
3833,Claire ," Sweetie, let's not talk about ling. It upsets you too much.",,,
3834,Phil , You know what I'm gonna do?,,,
3835,Claire , Hmm?,,,
3836,Phil ," I'm gonna buy a new remote... the same remote. And just to prove how wrong you are, I'm gonna teach our dumbest kid how to use it in 20 minutes or less.",,,
3837,Claire , Who's our dumbest kid?,,,
3838,Phil , Luke.,,,
3839,Claire ," Luke? No, Luke understands electronics. Haley.",,,
3840,Phil , No.,,,
3841,Claire ," Yeah. Haley. Teach Haley to use the remote, and then I'll apologize.",,,
3842,Phil , Haley?,,,
3843,Claire ,, Mm-hmm.,,
3844,Phil , Come on!,,,
3845,Jay," Hey, Shorty.",,,
3846,Jay ," It's me. Uh, I was thinking of heading over to the driving range and hitting a few balls... you want to join me? I don't know. Wear... Wear whatever you want.",,,
3847,Cameron ," Oh, my god. Oh, god.",,,
3848,Mitchell , What?,,,
3849,Cameron , The flowers... they look so much better. This is a disaster.,,,
3850,Mitchell ," You do know what ""disaster"" means, right? ",,,
3851,Cameron , You don't understand. I demanded that they come exchange them. I got all medieval on the florist.,,,
3852,Mitchell ," Cam, I heard you on the phone, you said you were displeased, but that's hardly going medieval.",,,
3853,Cameron ," Excuse me. I said ""very displeased,"" and I used my cowboy voice, so...",,,
3854,Mitchell , W-what are you doing?,,,
3855,Cameron , I'm microwaving them so they look bad again.,,,
3856,Mitchell ," Well, that seems a little crazy, doesn't it?",,,
3857,Cameron ," Oh, no. That's the florist.",,,
3858,Mitchell ," Look, relax. Just take them out. I'll get the door. He'll never know the difference. Hi.",,,
3859,Florist , Florist.,,,
3860,Mitchell ," Hi. Yes, uh, come on in. He's... he's over there with the flowers.",,,
3861,Cameron ," Hello. I don't know what happened. They just, uh, somehow lost their vigor. They were like this when we came home.",,,
3862,Mitchell , Cam. Cam...,,,
3863,Cameron ," Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh! Oh! Oh, god! God! God!",,,
3864,Mitchell , Look at that. Two things flaming at once.,,,
3865,Jay , Damn it!,,,
3866,Shorty , You know what the problem is?,,,
3867,Jay , What?,,,
3868,Shorty , You're not moving your hips. They're frozen.,,,
3869,Jay , Hips?,,,
3870,Shorty ," Yeah, your hips. They're frozen. Here, let me show you.",,,
3871,Jay ," No, it's...",,,
3872,Shorty ," No, no, no, no, no. Don't fight me.",,,
3873,Jay ," All right, Shorty.",,,
3874,Shorty ," Just bring the club back. Go ahead. All right? Now turn those hips. That's it. You just got to relax. You got to open up the stance a little bit. Spad 'em, spread 'em. That's it. That'. If you don't relax, you're never gonna get that shaft where it belongs. ",,,
3875,Jay ," Hey, you know what? How about a coffee? Let's get a coffee.",,,
3876,Shorty , Sure.,,,
3877,Phil ," Now press the button labeled ""activities.""",,,
3878,Haley , Where is that?,,,
3879,Phil ," It's to the right. To the right. And then... and now choose ""watch dvd.""",,,
3880,Haley , What?!,,,
3881,Phil ," Honey, you got to focus. We've only got 20 minutes. Pretend... pretend the mall's closing.",,,
3882,Haley ," Dad, this is stupid. I watch tv on my computer. Why do I have to learn this?",,,
3883,Phil , Because your mom doesn't think you can.,,,
3884,Haley , Nobody can!,,,
3885,Phil ," Haley, listen to me. Listen to me. I know this seems impossible, But this is for all those times that mom told you she was right... And you knew she was wrong.",,,
3886,Haley , I'll do it.,,,
3887,Phil , That's my girl.,,,
3888,Shorty ," You know, that guy's got a beautiful stroke. Look at his pants. No pleats. I like pants like that. You think I can get away with something like that?",,,
3889,Jay ," Sure, why not? Listen, Shorty, uh... We've known each other a long time, right? What, 30 years?",,,
3890,Shorty , Yeah.,,,
3891,Jay ," And, uh... I sense that you got a secret that's maybe causing you a lot of anguish.",,,
3892,Shorty ," You heard something, right?",,,
3893,Jay ," Well, I had the same situation with my son, Mitchell.",,,
3894,Shorty , Really?,,,
3895,Jay ," And I didn't handle it too well, either. And, uh... I just want you to know that you can open up to me, That I'm gonna do all I can to help you. ",,,
3896,Shorty ," Well, I mean, I... I never said this out loud before to anyone, But I guess if I did, it would be you. It's just that, Jay, you see, I'm, uh... ...I'm...",,,
3897,Jay ," Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.",,,
3898,Shorty , ...I'm in debt.,,,
3899,Jay , Huh?,,,
3900,Shorty ," I owe a bookie 20 g's, and he's a serious guy. And you offering to give me the dough... this is beautiful!",,,
3901,Jay , Wait a minute. You're not gay?,,,
3902,Shorty ," Gay?! What are you talking about, gay? I'm not gay! Where'd you get gay?!",,,
3903,Jay ," Come on, I mean, you're always talking about clothes and everything, right?",,,
3904,Shorty , My father was a tailor. I like clothes. So what? Are you calling my father gay?,,,
3905,Jay , No!,,,
3906,Shorty ," My father landed on Normandy to save your ass. You know, if you weren't lending me 20 g's, I'd knock you out right now.",,,
3907,Jay , Take a check?,,,
3908,Shorty , Cash would be better.,,,
3909,Phil ," Haley, you ready?",,,
3910,Haley , Let's do this.,,,
3911,Claire , Turn on the tv.,,,
3912,Phil , Nice.,,,
3913,Claire , Mute it. Un-mute it. Put it on dvd. Skip forward.,,,
3914,Haley , Wait. Um...,,,
3915,Claire , Okay. Back to tv.,,,
3916,Phil , Face!,,,
3917,Claire ," Don't get all cocky, Phil. Let's see what happens to little Haley when I do this.",,,
3918,Phil , Ho! Ooh!,,,
3919,Claire , Face.,,,
3920,Haley ," Dad, w-what do I do?",,,
3921,Phil , Don't panic. We went through this. Just... just think. ,,,
3922,Claire , Give up? Give up. Admit defeat.,,,
3923,Phil , Haley...,,,
3924,Haley ," Okay, uh, let's see... You put the remote onto tv mode And then pre input till you get hdmi 1 and... Whoo! I did it!",,,
3925,Phil , She did it!,,,
3926,Claire ," Fine, you proved your point. Everybody in this house is smarter than me.",,,
3927,Phil ," No, honey, you're missing the point. I taught Haley how to use the remote in 20 minutes, So think how fast you can learn it.",,,
3928,Haley , What's that supposed to mean?,,,
3929,Phil , See what I'm saying?,,,
3930,Jay ," Mitchell, it's me!",,,
3931,Mitchell ," Hey, dad.",,,
3932,Jay , Hi.,,,
3933,Mitchell , Hi.,,,
3934,Jay , I'm here to let you know your gaydar is broken. Shorty is not gay.,,,
3935,Mitchell ," No. I, um, I knew that. I just, uh... I made that up to mess with you for dissing cam.",,,
3936,Jay ," What? That cost me 20,000 bucks.",,,
3937,Mitchell , What do you mean?,,,
3938,Jay ," I reached out to him, you know, to let him know it's okay to be gay.",,,
3939,Mitchell , You did?,,,
3940,Jay ," Yeah... Right after one of the stranger golf lessons of my life. Turns out what he is is a lousy gambler, And now I'm the one on the hook for it.",,,
3941,Mitchell ," Well, I'm so sorry.",,,
3942,Jay , Then why are you smiling?,,,
3943,Mitchell ," I'm... I'm proud of you, dad. You're growing.",,,
3944,Jay ," Just... just stop it, please? Don't you see how hard this is for me? See, I used to be just like one of those guys. Now look at me. I got a house, looks like little Colombia. I got a gay son and a Chinese granddaughter.",,,
3945,Mitchell , Vietnamese. ,,,
3946,Jay , Only you would know the difference.,,,
3947,Mitchell ," Okay, don't worry, dad. You're not growing too much.",,,
3948,Whitney , I'm a little nervous.,,,
3949,Gloria , Don't be!,,,

3955,Gloria , Cameron!,,,
3956,Cameron ," Hi! Sorry for the pop-over, but I just wanted to bring you these to thank you for babysitting Lily again last night. Gracias. You didn't need to do that. You know I love Lily.",,,

3963,Gloria , What about her hair?,,,
3964,Cameron ," Oh, my gosh. it's like Barbara Streisand in ""the way we were."" One of my favorites.",,,
3965,Whitney , Me too.,,,
3966,Cameron ," Okay, who is reading ""the forevers""?",,,
3967,Whitney , I am.,,,
3968,Cameron , I am so obsessed with this whole vampire thing right now.,,,
3969,Whitney , Me too!,,,
3970,Whitney , I just met the sweetest guy named Cameron. I think he might be the one. ,,,
3971,Mitchell , Can people change? I don't know. People are who they are... Give or take 15%. That's how much people can change if they really want to.,,,
3972,Jay ," Well, I'll see you when I see you.",,,
3973,Mitchell ," Yeah, thanks for com...",,,
3974,Jay , Okay. ,,,
3975,Jay ," Oh, well, that's a little, um...",,,

3977,Jay ," Yeah, fine, yeah.",,,
3978,Shorty ," Yo, hey, I like your hair. Who does your hair?",,,
3979,Man , Huh?,,,
3980,Shorty ," Yo, handsome, who does your hair? ",,,
3981,Claire ," Haley, sweetie, wake up.",,,
3982,Haley , What?,,,
3983,Claire , I need you to teach me to use the tv.,,,
3984,Haley , Now? Why can't dad teach you?,,,
3985,Phil , Because we're married.,,,
3986,Mitchell , Whether it's for themselves or for the people they love.,,,
3987,Claire , That way.,,,
3988,Haley , Yeah. And then press...,,,
3989,Claire ," Mmh. I got it. Yeah. Yeah,",,,
3990,Mitchell , 15%. But you know what? Sometimes that's just enough.,,,
3991,Jay ," All right, all right. See you guys next week, huh?",,,
3992,Shorty ," Listen, I want to thank you for, uh, you know, helping me out with that jam, you know.",,,
3993,Jay , It was nothing. It was nothing.,,,

3995,Jay ," Oh, come on. You didn't have to do that.",,,

4002,Phil , What are you doing with those?,,,
4003,Alex ," Luke and I are doing a recycling drive. If we collect enough bottles, they build a school in Africa.",,,
4004,Luke , Wouldn't that be so cool to go to a school made out of bottles?,,,
4005,Alex ," That would certainly be a special school. Did you hear what I said, parents... ""special school""?",,,
4006,Haley ," Okay. Nobody make a big deal about it, but I just broke up with Dylan.",,,
4007,Phil , No!,,,
4008,Claire ," Oh, my gosh. Are you okay, honey?",,,
4009,Haley ," Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I need to date someone who has a clue, instead of an idiot who bangs his head every time he rides his bike out of his garage. Every time.",,,
4010,Phil ," I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry for both of you. I'll have to text him later.",,,
4011,Claire , Mm. I got to jump in the shower. I'm gonna be late.,,,
4012,Luke , Where are you going?,,,

4015,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
4016,Luke , I can't imagine you working.,,,
4017,Phil ," Luke, let me tell you something. That is very offensive to women. Your mom works very hard... Just now, she works for us.",,,
4018,Claire ," I will have you know that I had quite the little career going. I was an account manager at Starcrest Hotels. I had a little cubicle, And I... and I wore my tennis shoes to work and changed into my work pumps. It was very ""working girl.""",,,

4025,Gloria , There's my lawyer!,,,
4026,Mitchell ," Gloria got into a little car accident, So my dad asked me to help her out. And, uh, this is the first time that my dad's asked me for legal advice, and it's... it's nice. It's nice to know that he respects me in that way.",,,
4027,Cameron ," Well, Mitchell is an amazing lawyer. My dream for him is that one day he'll be on the supreme court.",,,
4028,Mitchell ," Why, Cam?",,,
4029,Cameron ," So at parties, I can tell everyone my partner is one of the Supremes.",,,
4030,Cameron ," There he is! The steely, grizzled veteran ready to do battle with the plucky upstart. Speed versus grace. Brute force versus...",,,
4031,Jay , Let's just do this.,,,
4032,Cameron ," Jay and I are both gym rats. I love the sauna that's the dry heat... And the steam... wet. And, of course, I am just a kook for racquetball... Club champ two years in a row, Tonganoxie, Missouri, rec center. So, naturally, Jay and I have been trying for month to get together to bang the old hollow rubber ball around.",,,
4033,Jay ," I have been avoiding this day like the plague. I mean, part of going to the gym is the locker-room atmosphere. And if I'm there with a gay guy, it's just not gonna be the same. I mean, for me, it's a locker room. For him, it's a showroom. She doesn't get it. [OPENING CREDITS] ",,,
4034,Phil , * I'll let you see my scar * What the hell?,,,
4035,Phil ," Some people call me a salesman. I call myself a ""salesfriend."" So, obviously, I need strangers to trust me. I don't take kindly to it when someone Tom Sellecks my bus bench.",,,
4036,Phil , Phil Dunphy.,,,
4037,Barbara ," Phil, it's Barbara. The Pattersons want to back out of the deal.",,,
4038,Phil , Why?! What happened?!,,,
4039,Barbara , The wife's getting cold feet. I told her to call you.,,,
4040,Phil , Okay. Fine. I'll handle it. I'm not losing this sale!,,,
4041,Barbara , By the way...,,,
4042,Phil , I've spend way too much time on it.,,,
4043,Barbara ," Um, Phil, do you take Elm when you come to...",,,
4044,Phil ," I saw it, Barbara.",,,
4045,Cameron ," It's a terrific gym, Jay. Very liberal with the towels. I love that.",,,
4046,Jay ," Showers are private, in case you're wondering.",,,
4047,Cameron ," I wasn't, but thanks for the heads-up. Now, that's a surprise... boxers.",,,
4048,Jay , Is that necessary?,,,
4049,Cameron ," Well, I just always pictured you as a tighty-whitey guy",,,
4050,Jay ," Well, do me a favor the next time you picture me, leave the underwear out of it.",,,
4051,Cameron ," Well, don't you worry. The only thing I'm picturing is how clean the floor is gonna be When I'm done mopping it with you.",,,
4052,Jay , Is that the best you can do? 'cause it's gonna take a little more than some lame trash talk to get me out of my... Gah! What the hell was that?!,,,
4053,Cameron , Our butts pressed against each other.,,,
4054,Jay , They didn't press. It was glancing. Stop talking about it! ,,,
4055,Cameron ," Oh, come on. All the time you've spent in the locker room, this can't be your first moon landing.",,,
4056,Jay , You got a name for it?,,,
4057,Cameron , It's very common. You got off easy. At least it didn't happen after a shower.,,,
4058,Jay , Enough.,,,
4059,Cameron , We call that a splashdown.,,,
4060,Jay , That's it. I'm changing in the stall. Excuse me!,,,

4063,Haley , I said we are over. Why don't you go out for a nice bike ride?!,,,
4064,Phil ," Dylan again, huh? Some guys just do not know how to play it.",,,
4065,Haley ," Dad, what are you doing?",,,
4066,Phil ," Oh, right. Just, uh, test-driving my new soup strainer. I dug it out of the Halloween stuff to see what people think.",,,
4067,Phil ," Do people want their real-estate advice from someone who leads or from someone who follows? I'm betting these babies are coming back in a big way. Buy low, sell high. People are gonna see this and say, ""that guy's high.""",,,

4083,Valerie , Was I?,,,
4084,Claire , A little.,,,
4085,Valerie , I'm so sorry.,,,
4086,Claire ," And just then, it hit me. She was jealous of me. Yes, there had always been a little bit of a competition between us. This was more serious. She was looking at my life as something that she'd always wanted... but never had.",,,
4087,Claire ," So, how's life in the trenches?",,,
4088,Valerie ," You know, you still got the bastards on the 23rd floor making life miserable for all the people actually doing the work.",,,

4095,Gloria ," I was driving along this street. The cars were parked just like this, And... boom!... Out of nowhere, he hits me.",,,
4096,Mitchell ," Okay, so, he... he cut you off.",,,
4097,Gloria , Yes.,,,
4098,Mitchell , Right.,,,
4099,Gloria , A crazy driver.,,,
4100,Mitchell ," You know, I used to be a little bit like that. I don't know, maybe it's because of Lily, But I've definitely become more considerate. Like, I used to never let people in, and now I do. I'm just now getting that metaphor. Okay.",,,
4101,Gloria ," So, what do you think?",,,
4102,Mitchell , Were there any witnesses?,,,
4103,Gloria ," No, just Manny. He was in the back seat.",,,
4104,Manny ," It all happened so fast, just like they say.",,,
4105,Mitchell ," Yeah. All right, well, this is what we're gonna do. I'll take a few pictures, and then we'll sit down and write a statement.",,,
4106,Gloria , Perfect. I'll go and get us a table.,,,
4107,Mitchell , All right.,,,
4108,Gloria ," Manny, come.",,,
4109,Manny ," Uh, just a minute, mom. I need to tie my shoe.",,,
4110,Gloria , Okay.,,,
4111,Manny , Mitchell.,,,
4112,Mitchell , Yeah?,,,
4113,Manny , Don't talk. Listen. It was her fault.,,,
4114,Mitchell ," I'm... I'm sorry, what?",,,
4115,Manny , Don't look at me. Do something. Take pictures.,,,
4116,Gloria , Manny! What kind of cupcake do you want?,,,
4117,Manny ," Uh, that's okay! I'm not hungry! That was a mistake. Now she'll know something's up.",,,
4118,Mitchell , Are you okay?!,,,
4119,Manny , I'm fine! She cut that guy off. She's a terrible driver. She's a danger to us all.,,,
4120,Mitchell , Okay. Wait. Now stop. I-I thought she said he was parked and then he cut her off. ,,,
4121,Manny , Everybody looks parked When you're going 100 miles an hour!,,,
4122,Mitchell ," Manny, why didn't you speak up?",,,
4123,Manny ," She can't take criticism about her driving. Once, an old lady yelled at her at a crosswalk. She honked so long the horn ran out.",,,
4124,Gloria , Manny!,,,
4125,Manny , I've said too much already.,,,
4126,Mitchell , Are you hearing this?,,,
4127,Jay , Aah...,,,
4128,Cameron , Point.,,,
4129,Jay , Hinder! Aah! Boom! Lucky shot!,,,
4130,Cameron ," That is game! And, I believe, match.",,,
4131,Jay ," Yep. Fine. You won. But, you know, what do you expect? For the first half of the game, I was distracted by what happened in the locker room.",,,
4132,Cameron , And you're sure it's not because I'm a fabulous racquetball player?,,,
4133,Jay ," You're average, but I was a little thrown by you touching me, which is unnatural. Not to you, of course. No, to you, it's like rocket fuel.",,,
4134,Cameron ," Oh, sure. When you're gay, you just walk around giving butt bumps to everybody. It's like a high-five. It a low-two.",,,
4135,Jay ," You know what? I'm gonna prove that you won only because I was distracted. We're gonna have a rematch right here, right now.",,,
4136,Cameron , Do you want to go up against me again?,,,
4137,Jay , Yes. No! Damn it! Hello!,,,
4138,Mitchell ," Hey, dad. Uh, did you know that the accident was Gloria's fault?",,,
4139,Jay ," Yes. I mean, I wasn't there, But she's a horrible driver. If she hit 10 cars, I wouldn't be surprised.",,,
4140,Mitchell ," If you knew that it was her fault, Why did you get me involved?",,,
4141,Jay ," Because someone has to tell her she's in the wrong, and better you than me. ",,,
4142,Mitchell ," That's great. I... Here I am thinking that my dad actually respects me as lawyer, And, really, you're just throwing me to the wolves.",,,
4143,Jay , Can't it be both?,,,
4144,Mitchell ," Okay, dad, it doesn't it doesn't bother you in the least that your gay son's the only one tough enough to stand up to your wife?",,,
4145,Jay ," Go get 'em, rocky. See you later.",,,
4146,Cameron , Your father and I had a moon landing in the locker room!,,,
4147,Jay , What's the matter with you?,,,
4148,Claire ," What about you? I mean, did you ever get serious with anyone?",,,
4149,Valerie ," Thank you. Oh, no. Not yet.",,,
4150,Claire ," Ohh. Honey, you will.",,,
4151,Valerie ," Oh, no. I hope not. It's... it's fun. I'm sorry. I'm just I'm waiting for some news.",,,
4152,Claire , What news?,,,
4153,Valerie , I'm... I'm up for the Paris job.,,,
4154,Claire , The... the head of the international division?! That's... that's... that's crazy.,,,
4155,Valerie ," Yeah, no, I mean, I'll never get it, but it'd be great, 'cause... Well, 'cause one of my lovers lives in Paris.",,,
4156,Claire ," Oh. I-I don't know what jumps out of that sentence more, you know, ""lovers"" or ""one of.""",,,
4157,Valerie ," Well, I'm single. I mean, it's kind of what you do.",,,
4158,Claire , Uh-huh.,,,
4159,Valerie , I have one in Paris.,,,
4160,Claire , Oh.,,,
4161,Valerie ," Um, I have Paris, New York, Miami... I have a fourth one. I'm forgetting my lover. I'm forgetting my lover.",,,
4162,Claire ," Last night, I vacuumed the radiator thingy under the fridge, you know, That collects the dust, 'cause you should, and I don't, so...",,,
4163,Valerie ," oh, hey. Hold on. Cross your fingers. ",,,
4164,Claire ," I'm not gonna lie. The thought of Valerie getting the one job in the whole company that everyone coveted... well, I wasn't a lover of that.",,,
4165,Valerie ," Okay. Okay, thank you.",,,
4166,Claire , Well?,,,
4167,Valerie ," Oh, they haven't made a decision. They're... they're gonna tell me later on.",,,
4168,Claire ," That's not what they said, is it?",,,
4169,Valerie ," Oh, yeah. It is. It is.",,,
4170,Claire ," Oh, Valerie, come on. It's me. What are friends for, if not to be there for you when you get bad news?",,,
4171,Valerie , I got it!,,,
4172,Claire ," Oh, my god!",,,
4173,Valerie , Aah! I'm the head of Europe!,,,
4174,Claire ," Well, you know, for the hotel, Not the continent, But...Yay!",,,
4175,Valerie ," Kind of, though. Kind of.",,,
4176,Claire , Why didn't you tell me when you first heard?,,,
4177,Valerie ," Ohh... 'cause, you know.",,,
4178,Claire ," And that's when it really hit me. Valerie wasn't jealous of me. She pitied me. And part of me wanted to take her back to the house and show her everything she was missing in her sad, childless, husbandless life. But there's a little thing called ""taking the high road.""",,,
4179,Claire , Why don't you come by and meet everybody?,,,
4180,Valerie ," Oh, sure. Yeah, no, that'd be great.",,,
4181,Claire ," Yeah, I mean, Alex is just a genius, and Haley is turning into this beautiful young woman. and it makes me realize that motherhood is probably the most important...",,,
4182,Valerie ," San Francisco. That was my fourth lover. San Francisco. ""Fourth lover."" It would have kept me up all night.",,,
4183,Claire , Yeah. ,,,
4184,Luke ," Dad, look.",,,
4185,Phil ," Just a sec, buddy. I'm on my way out to the bathroom.",,,
4186,Alex ," Check it out. The Aubreys had this huge party last night, and we got all these bottles to recycle.",,,
4187,Phil , Great!,,,
4188,Alex , What's Jagermeister?,,,
4189,Phil ," Um... Well, you know how in a fairy tale there's always a potion that makes the princess fall asleep and then the guys start kissing her? Well, this is like that, except you don't wake up in a castle. You wake up in a frat house with a bad reputation.",,,
4190,Dylan , Haley!,,,
4191,Alex ," Luke, you're spilling it!",,,
4192,Luke ," Aw, crud!",,,
4193,Alex , God! Aah! Gross! A rat!,,,
4194,Luke , Cool.,,,
4195,Haley ," Hang on, I'm coming!",,,
4196,Dylan , I believe you have something that belongs to me... My heart.,,,
4197,Haley , I thought I I.M.'d you to stay away.,,,
4198,Dylan , Ow! Haley!,,,
4199,Phil ," Hello? Dylan? D-money? Hey, buddy? Hey, buddy?! Hello, friendly neighbors! Little help?",,,
4200,Dylan , But I love you!,,,
4201,Haley ," Well, you should have thought about that before you took that skank Sharon Nicolini to an Anne Hathaway movie!",,,
4202,Dylan , I didn't take her. She was just there.,,,
4203,Haley , So you were just there by yourself at an Anne Hathaway movie! I don't think so!,,,
4204,Dylan , Yeah! Yeah. I like her movies. She's every woman! Come on. Let's not fight. Let's just discuss this like two un-immature adults.,,,
4205,Haley , Ugh! ,,,
4206,Phil ," Oh. Oh. Hello? Mrs. Patterson. Hi. I've been waiting for your call. Yeah. Um, is there any chance that maybe we could talk a little bit... No, no. Now's perfect. That's fine. I-I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Let me just... Close my office door. there we go. Much, much better.",,,
4207,Mitchell , Maybe we should go over the accident one more time?,,,
4208,Gloria , Put the ducks on a row. You're such a good lawyer.,,,
4209,Mitchell ," Uh, yeah, I just want to make sure We're 100% clear on exactly what happened.",,,
4210,Gloria ," Oh, we're clear. I told you. What? You don't believe me?",,,
4211,Mitchell ," No! No! I just... You know, sometimes. Like, is it possible, maybe, you were driving too fast?",,,
4212,Gloria , Who said I was driving fast?,,,
4213,Manny , Yeah. Who?,,,
4214,Mitchell ," I just... I'm looking at the street, and I'm thinking if you were driving a little fast, It's possible that maybe you didn't see the car...",,,
4215,Gloria ," You're like everyone else, huh? You blame the latino driver. Where I come from, they always blame the latino driver.",,,
4216,Mitchell ," Where you come from, isn't everybody a latino driver?",,,
4217,Gloria ," Manny, tell him.",,,
4218,Manny , I can't 'cause I have cupcake in my mouth.,,,
4219,Gloria ," Oh, come on! Don't blame your cupcake! What? You think I'm guilty, too?",,,
4220,Manny , No.,,,
4221,Gloria ," Fine. I don't need you as a lawyer anymore. and if you two think I'm such a bad driver, you're safer walking home! Ciao!",,,
4222,Claire , Here it is.,,,
4223,Valerie , It's really cute!,,,
4224,Claire , Yeah. We're pretty proud of it.,,,
4225,Haley , Here's your stupid CDs! And your clothes! And your poems!,,,
4226,Dylan , Don't you do it! ,,,
4227,Claire , Haley!,,,
4228,Haley , I'm doing it!,,,
4229,Claire ," Haley, stop it! What are you doing?!",,,
4230,Dylan , Tearing out my heart!,,,
4231,Claire , Okay.,,,
4232,Haley," Oh, why don't you go get a hickey from Sharon Nicolini?!",,,
4233,Dylan ," It's from my guitar strap, Haley!",,,
4234,Haley ," Oh, thanks for reminding me!",,,
4235,Claire ," Um, it's my daughter Haley and her boyfriend, Dylan, um...",,,
4236,Valerie , This is a nice color.,,,
4237,Claire ," Yeah. Um, listen. this is not normal with all that, nor... Where's that liquor smell? Phil, honey? Oh, my god. Luke? What is that?",,,
4238,Luke , Jagermeister. Dad says it makes girls easier to kiss.,,,
4239,Claire , What happened to the rug?!,,,
4240,Luke , I had an accident.,,,
4241,Claire ," Okay. Alex, what are you doing?",,,
4242,Alex , I'm trying to kill a rat.,,,
4243,Claire , Oh...,,,
4244,Dylan , Sharon was helping me buy you a birthday present! Don't you get it? I love your ass!,,,
4245,Valerie ," I... you know, I-I-I'm late. And I should go.",,,
4246,Claire ," I know. I know. Yeah And it seems like things have gotten a little wonky around here. I don't know where Phil is. He's definitely... Oh, my god! Alex! Where is your father?",,,
4247,Alex , He went outside to go to the bathroom.,,,
4248,Claire ," Uh-huh. Oh! It's not usually like this. Oh, gross.",,,
4249,Dylan , Let's just get married.,,,
4250,Haley , Okay.,,,
4251,Phil ," You will not regret this decision, Mrs. Patterson. And I'll tell you what... We're gonna have you over to our little house to celebrate, okay? Okay. Buh-bye.",,,
4252,Claire ," Sometime when you get a break, maybe... ",,,

4268,Valerie , So nice to see you.,,,
4269,Phil ," Great to see you, though.",,,

4284,Phil , Ow!,,,
4285,Jay ," I told you I'd win! Not talking so much now, are you, hotshot? Hope you enjoy that nice hot shower. But it's not gonna wash away the shame of that 15-7 beatdown. You should have seen the look on your face When that drop shot just kissed the wall. Ah. Okay. Splashdown. Got me again. Yep. Make the uptight straight guy all embarrassed, except for one thing doesn't even bother me anymore. I could do this all day. Here. Another one for you. Maybe a couple of them.",,,

4288,Manny ," Well, if you're going to be stranded, might as well be in a place full of cupcakes.",,,
4289,Mitchell , I don't think you need any more.,,,
4290,Gloria ," Ay. I'm sorry, guys. It's true. I am a defensive driver.",,,
4291,Manny , You mean you're defensive about...,,,
4292,Gloria , I know what I am. Let's go. It's just that I don't like When people just assume that I'm a bad driver. Maybe it was just like a little bit my fault.,,,
4293,Mitchell ," Well, you know, I'm glad you can admit that, Gloria.",,,
4294,Gloria ," Ay. But I'm still gonna need you as my lawyer, Mitch. Mitchell Why?",,,
4295,Gloria , Because this one... It was not my fault. I promise you.,,,

4303,Phil , She probably won't be up for a couple hours still.,,,
4304,Dylan ," Oh, it's okay. It's not that heavy. ",,,
4305,Claire ," At that moment, all I wanted was to be with my family. But of course, that meant finding a way to apologize to the people that I had belittled and rejected.",,,
4306,Phil ," Okay, you are so crazy. That song totally rules.",,,
4307,Alex ," Dad, you're crazy.",,,
4308,Phil , Crazy right.,,,
4309,Phil ," Hey, honey.",,,

4311,Haley ," Hey, mom.",,,
4312,Luke ," No, seriously, dad. It's lame.",,,
4313,Phil ," Seriously, Luke. It's not. Here, you got some mustard or something on your face. I think I know a little bit about music. I was a deejay in college. I had my own show in the coveted time slot... ""daybreak with Dunphy.""",,,
4314,Alex , Are you kidding me?,,,
4315,Phil ," No, I'm not kidding you. And I played Rick Astley.",,,

4317,Phil ," Sing it, Luke.",,,
4318,Claire ," They could have been petty. They really could have made me pay, but they didn't. And I've never loved them more. Why the hell couldn't Valerie have seen them like that?",,,

4347,Jay , You're gonna love him. Trust me. The guy's hilarious!,,,
4348,Gloria , Okay. Tell me one of his jokes.,,,
4349,Jay ," Well, he doesn't do jokes.",,,
4350,Gloria , Does he have a mallet?,,,
4351,Jay , No.,,,
4352,Gloria ," So, then, how does he get hit in the head?",,,
4353,Jay ," He doesn't get ""hit in the head."" He... he makes observations He tells the truth in a funny way. Come on, he's been on ""Johnny Carson"" a hundred times.",,,
4354,Gloria , Who the hell is Johnny Carson? ,,,
4355,Jay ," Oh, for God's sake.",,,
4356,Jay ," Gloria and I are from different generations, And I won't lie... it isn't always easy. I mean, last week she thought Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.",,,
4357,Gloria ," No, I didn't.",,,
4358,Jay , It was a joke.,,,
4359,Gloria , I don't get it.,,,
4360,Jay , Maybe that's because there's no mallet.,,,
4361,Gloria ," Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now.",,,
4362,Mitchell , Just stay in Northern Cal... Did you indicate to her... ...How long that you were gonna take?,,,

4370,Mitchell , I don't see how. You just cut up one of your boas.,,,
4371,Cameron ," Actually, no, we repurposed it. It was sort of a ""Bob Mackie meets Martha Stewart"" project. Okay, well, we just thought it would be a nice surprise.",,,
4372,Mitchell ," Well, it's hardly a surprise. I mean, you dress her up for every holiday. I was giving her a bath last night, and I still saw traces of Martin Luther King behind her ear.",,,
4373,Cameron ," All right, not in the spirit. We get it.",,,
4374,Mitchell ," No, I'm s... I'm sorry. No, it's adorable. I just... I'm really nervous about my closing argument.",,,

4395,Claire ," No. No, no. You don't need to. At all. I'll take it.",,,
4396,Phil ," Did he trump me? D-money. You tell me. He made a painting out of a photograph one time. I have handpicked a card, drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet, and taken Claire to Fratelli's, a family-style Italian restaurant, for 17 years in a row. Yeah, he got me. He got me. ",,,
4397,Phil ," You know, we don't have to go to Fratelli's tonight.",,,

4407,Phil , I always do.,,,
4408,Claire ," Phil? Sweetie. As long as we're talking about being a little bit... naughty, What would you say to a little... role playing?",,,
4409,Phil , Role playing?,,,
4410,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,

4413,Phil , And I'll swing by after work to pick you up.,,,
4414,Claire ," No, no. Why don't you meet me in the hotel bar and see if you can pick me up there?",,,
4415,Phil ," Careful, lady, you're gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant. Perhaps I'll be Reginald Appleby, an English gentleman in town for a polo match.",,,
4416,Claire , Phil.,,,
4417,Phil , Or honorable businessman from Hong Kong...,,,
4418,Claire , You're kinda wrecking it.,,,
4419,Phil ," Oh. It's not a big deal, Claire. I just train tigers for a living. Too... no?",,,
4420,Claire , No.  [OPENING CREDITS],,,
4421,Phil ," Bye, honey.",,,
4422,Claire , See you later.,,,
4423,Phil , See you later.,,,
4424,Claire ," Phil, what is that? ",,,
4425,Mitchell , Are these rose petals?,,,
4426,Cameron ," Yes, to commemorate our love.",,,
4427,Mitchell , I had to settle.,,,
4428,Cameron ," Well, your mom might think so, but a lot of people think I'm a catch. ",,,
4429,Mitchell ," No, the case. I-I was this close to nailing it, And then my client gets scared and settles.",,,
4430,Cameron , I'm sorry. Maybe you'd like a chocolate. Notice that I have not eaten any of the chocolates.,,,
4431,Mitchell ," There were two levels. You know it, and I know it. This is so frustrating. I had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time... All about the big government rolling over the little guy. And I even had this great moment at the end where I would point to the state seal and I'd say, ""shame!""",,,
4432,Cameron ," Oh, that's what you were doing in the shower. I was a little worried. Um, that's Manny. I said we would watch him tonight. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know you were gonna be going through all this.",,,
4433,Mitchell ," No, it's fine. It might be nice to have him around. He always makes me laugh.",,,
4434,Cameron ," Hi, Manny!",,,
4435,Manny , The universe is cold and loveless.,,,
4436,Cameron , Uh-oh. Bad valentine's day?,,,
4437,Manny ," I went for the gold... Fiona Gunderson. I poured my heart and soul into a poem, Left it on her desk. I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.",,,
4438,Cameron , And she didn't like it?,,,
4439,Manny ," Oh, she loved it. But this kid Durkas told her he wrote it.",,,
4440,Mitchell ," Well, Manny, why didn't you just tell her the truth?",,,
4441,Manny ," She was already gone. And she's on a date with him at my favorite restaurant, Great shakes.",,,
4442,Cameron , How do you know all this?,,,
4443,Manny ," I invited her in the poem. Right after the line of, ""my love is deeper than the great lakes.""",,,
4444,Cameron ,," Okay, well, this is unacceptable.",,
4445,Mitchell ,," Oh, here we go.",,
4446,Cameron ," No, it's not that big of a deal. This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna shoot over to great shakes, We're gonna get a table, Manny can reclaim the love of his life. You and I can get a couple mudslides. ",,,
4447,Manny , I don't know. Durkas is gonna be there. I've seen the kid do a pull-up.,,,
4448,Cameron ," Hey, Manny, it's valentine's day. It's not the day you run away from love. It's the day you track it down, tie it up, and take it home. Now, if we can pull this off, you and your little lady friend will be belly up to an ice-cream counter, having a milkshake with two straws. What do you say?",,,
4449,Manny , I like it.,,,
4450,David Brenner ," Thank you. Thank you. Scientists, they don't know why this is true, but it's true. Women with big rear ends live longer. Men who tell them that, don't. Did you read about this man... The 91-year-old bank robber in Texas? He goes into a bank, you know. ""What the hell did I want?"" They had over 4,000 photos of him escaping from the bank.",,,
4451,Jay ," See? He's funny, huh?",,,
4452,Phil , Mind if I join you? I'm Clive. Clive Bixby.,,,
4453,Claire ," Yes, I can see that. I'm Juliana. So, Clive, are you in town for a convention, or do you... just forget your name a lot?",,,
4454,Phil , Pretty kitty has nails. I like that. I'm in town for a trade show. I design high-end electroacoustic transducers.,,,
4455,Claire ," Wow, that is very... specific.",,,
4456,Phil , It's a fancy way of saying I get things to make noise.,,,
4457,Claire , Hmm.,,,
4458,Phil ," Two, please. So, what's your story? The miss America pageant in town?",,,
4459,Claire ," Well, you're pretty smooth talker, Clive.",,,
4460,Phil , I'm pretty smooth all over.,,,
4461,Claire , Oh.,,,
4462,Waitress ," Sir, there's no smoking in here.",,,
4463,Phil ," Oh, that's fine. I'm not actually a smok...",,,
4464,Claire ," You're quite the boy scout, Clive. Tell me, would you be interested in earning a merit badge tonight? Do you know anything about tying knots?",,,
4465,Phil , I probably shouldn't be talking to you. I'm a married man. ,,,
4466,Claire ," Ah. Well, I just so happen to like married men. Tell me about your wife.",,,
4467,Phil ," Well, she's beautiful, of course.",,,
4468,Claire ," Really? Well, if she's so very beautiful, why are you here with me?",,,
4469,Phil ," Because she's always so tired, and she's always making lists of things for me to do.",,,
4470,Claire ," Maybe if you did them, she wouldn't be so tired.",,,
4471,Phil ," Oh, no, she can make lists for days. But back to your mouth and how sexy it is.",,,
4472,Claire , Unh-unh. I want to go back to these alleged lists and your nagging wife.,,,
4473,Phil , I-I'm not talking about you. I didn't mean that. Can we try this again?,,,
4474,Claire ," Yeah. So, if your wife is so beautiful, why are you here with me?",,,
4475,Phil , Because... I respect her too much to do to her what I'm going... to do to you?,,,
4476,Claire ," Oh, jackpot. I'll be right back, Clive.",,,
4477,Cameron , Do you have eyes on her? Is she here?,,,
4478,Manny ,,00... the blonde at the back table.,,
4479,Cameron , Yep. Have a visual.,,,
4480,Mitchell , Let's not talk like that anymore. Over.,,,
4481,Manny ," Okay, this is it. I'm off to win the heart of my beloved.",,,
4482,Cameron ," Well, this is nice. I mean, if we can't have our own valentine's day, It's nice that we can give somebody else one.",,,
4483,Mitchell ," All right, Cam... I'm sorry. I'm so... I'm sorry I have not been attentive. I've been spending the last five months pouring my core beliefs into the greatest speech that I will ever write, And then that moment gets taken away.",,,
4484,Cameron ," Hey, buddy, how'd it go?",,,
4485,Manny , I can't do it. Not while Durkas is there. He has the natural confidence. I admire it and fear it.,,,
4486,Cameron , We will deal with him directly. We need a plan.,,,
4487,Mitchell , Could you be more dramatic? ,,,
4488,Cameron , we need a plan!,,,
4489,David Brenner ," In Oregon, the state legislature ratified a bill that from now on it is a crime to have sex in Oregon with a farm animal. How ugly are the women in Oregon?",,,

4492,David Brenner , See? I can tell... you're not... you're not from Oregon.,,,
4493,Gloria ," No, no.",,,
4494,David Brenner , You... you are gorgeous.,,,
4495,Gloria , Thank you.,,,
4496,David Brenner , Thank you for bringing your father to the show.,,,
4497,Jay ," I'm... I'm her husband, Dave.",,,
4498,David Brenner , No kidding?,,,
4499,Jay , Yeah.,,,
4500,David Brenner ," What's it like to be married to someone who was there when the bible was written? What was it called then, just ""the testament""?",,,
4501,Jay , That's... that's good stuff.,,,
4502,David Brenner ," Oh, now he's trying to turn out the light.",,,
4503,Durkas , Hello?,,,
4504,Cameron ," Uh, yes, hello. Mr. Durkas?",,,
4505,Durkas , Yeah?,,,
4506,Cameron ," Uh, yeah, this is Don Jolly With the great shakes corporate office, And I have good news for you. You have been selected to take part in a random survey that you could win cash and prizes. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?",,,
4507,Durkas , Yeah. Sure.,,,
4508,Cameron ," Okay, just a few simple questions for you. Would you please rank your favorite ice creams at great shakes from least favorite to favorite?",,,
4509,Durkas , I don't know them by heart.,,,
4510,Cameron , There should be a menu right there to your right. To your right. Mm-hmm. There you go. ,,,

4512,Manny ," Hi, Fiona. Can I join you?",,,
4513,Fiona , I guess so.,,,

4515,Jay , Yeah.,,,
4516,David Brenner ," So, tell me, on the wedding night, what did he do? Did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable and go into a coma?",,,
4517,Jay ," Ah, ah... Listen, I got to use the men's room.",,,
4518,Gloria , No.,,,
4519,Jay , I got to use... I'll be right back.,,,
4520,David Brenner ," Where you going? Wait a minute. I'm only joking. That's what I do. You know, you're way younger than I am. You just don't look it.",,,
4521,Claire , Clive. I have a little something for you.,,,

4533,Cameron , Uh-huh. Go on.,,,
4534,Durkas , Vanilla.,,,
4535,Cameron ," I'm taking copious notes. Keep going, Mr. Durkas. ",,,
4536,Fiona ," So, why would ted say he wrote the poem if he didn't?",,,
4537,Manny , Maybe because you're the cutest girl in school and you have a laugh that makes science lab seem like recess.,,,
4538,Cameron , Would you be more or less inclined to visit a great shakes establishment if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed?,,,
4539,Durkas , That's a dumb question.,,,
4540,Cameron ," Excuse me, it is not a dumb question, mister... Tarnation. He hung up.",,,
4541,Mitchell , Then you can drop the accent.,,,

4677,Cameron , Losing Mitchell.,,,
4678,Mitchell , Oh! Hotel bedspreads.,,,
4679,Haley , Never getting my driver's license. Or getting one and the picture sucks.,,,

4684,Haley , Why are you hounding me? I'm freaking out right now!,,,
4685,Claire , You need to relax. It's just a driver's test.,,,
4686,Haley ," It's my third driver's test, and if I fail again, I have to wait six months to retake it. That's six more months of you driving me everywhere.",,,
4687,Haley ," And then I'm like, ""there's no way I'm wearing that."" And she was like, ""well, if you don't wear it, then you can't play."" ""like."" And then I was like, ""well, you know what? That's fine by me.""",,,

4699,Claire ," Sweetie, we need to get you some shoes for the dance tonight.",,,
4700,Alex ," No, we don't. I'm not going.",,,
4701,Claire , What are you talking about? Why would you not be going to the dance?,,,
4702,Alex , Because school dances are lame. A bunch of immature boys trying to impress you with how cool they are when they're really just a bunch of dorks.,,,
4703,Phil ," Ready to go down under, mate?",,,
4704,Luke , Yes.,,,
4705,Alex , What are you doing?,,,

Here's the thing -- we have no idea what he's talking about. All week, Luke and I have been getting more and more excited about what it could be.",,,
4709,Luke , I bet it's really cool old magazines.,,,
4710,Phil , Yeah. Or a bunch of necklaces made out of animal teeth.,,,
4711,Luke , Or bugs frozen in amber.,,,
4712,Phil , What if it's really expensive bottles of wine?,,,
4713,Luke , Or a suit of armor.,,,
4714,Phil , What if there's ancient Indian arrowheads under there?,,,
4715,Luke , What if it's gold bars?,,,
4716,Phil ," Oh, you think? ",,,
4717,Claire ," For god's sakes, why don't you go under the house and look? [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
4718,Mitchell ," Hey, cam. Cam, where did we get this dolly from?",,,
4719,Cameron ," Oh, from Janice and Olivia. They brought it over yesterday. Lily loves it.",,,
4720,Mitchell ," It seems a little frilly, you know, coming from them.",,,
4721,Cameron ," What, because they're lesbians? That's sort of an offensive stereotype, don't you think?",,,
4722,Mitchell ," Yeah, I suppose. I'm sorry. Oh, hey, did they bring back our coffee maker?",,,
4723,Cameron ," No, it was too big, they were on the motorcycle.",,,

4731,Mitchell , Do you hear any now?,,,
4732,Mitchell , I don't even know why we're doing this.,,,

4734,Mitchell ," Well, maybe if you bake her a cake, She'll give us free xrays.",,,
4735,Cameron , It's all about making connections. Why do you think the dentist gives me all that free stuff?,,,
4736,Mitchell ," Um, because he's a huge queen and he has a big crush on you. ",,,
4737,Cameron , Really? Do you think so?,,,
4738,Manny , Mom?,,,
4739,Gloria , Hmm?,,,
4740,Manny , I have a fever.,,,
4741,Gloria ," Ay, mi amor, come here, and I feel you.",,,

4744,Gloria ," Let me feel you. Ay, papi, but you're not warm.",,,
4745,Manny ," Uh, probably because you were cooking and your hands are warm. I'd better skip the party tomorrow just to be safe.",,,
4746,Gloria ," Oh, yeah, the party.",,,
4747,Jay , What?,,,
4748,Gloria , The party.,,,
4749,Jay , I understand about 20% of what goes on around here.,,,
4750,Gloria ," The party is at an amusement park, And Manny is afraid of roller coasters.",,,
4751,Jay , Poor kid.,,,
4752,Gloria ," I don't know where he gets his fear from, Because his father's not afraid of anything... No bulls, no heights, no helicopters, no fast cars.",,,
4753,Jay , But go to dinner with him and wait for the check to come. Then you'll see fear in his eyes... Like the waiter's a ghost.,,,
4754,Phil , Excited?,,,
4755,Luke , Yeah.,,,
4756,Phil , We're like Ponce de Leun and his son. Little Ponce.,,,
4757,Luke , Who's that?,,,
4758,Phil , Famous treasure hunters.,,,
4759,Luke ," His name was Ponce? He'd get made fun of at my school. They'd probably call him ""pants.""",,,
4760,Phil ," Ahahaha! ""Pants."" Or maybe, um, ""fancy Ponce.""",,,
4761,Luke , That's a good one.,,,
4762,Phil ," All right. Let's do this. oh, hey, wow.",,,
4763,Luke ," You okay, dad? ",,,
4764,Phil ," Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yep. Gonna take a little more than getting trapped In a small, dark space with a wild animal to rattle your old man. All right. ",,,
4765,Mitchell , Well! Her first word was every gay father's worst nightmare.,,,
4766,Cameron , Mommy. ,,,
4767,Phil ," You never want your kids to see you scared. You want to be that rock that they can grab a hold of in a stormy sea. Actually, a rock would sink, so a floating rock. Let's start over. It's windy, and you've got a lot of papers. ",,,
4768,Gloria ," But I know that Manny's sad because he's missing the pa Why don't we take him somewhere to take his mind off it, hmm?",,,
4769,Jay , I could have guessed he'd have trouble with roller coasters. That kid gets woozy at barbershops when they spin his chair towards the mirror.,,,
4770,Gloria ," How about we take him to the pier and go fishing, huh? Manny!",,,
4771,Jay , He likes to fish?,,,
4772,Gloria , Yeah. He comes from a long line of fishermen and smugglers. But I encourage the fishing.,,,
4773,Jay ," Manny, you like to fish?",,,
4774,Manny , Fishing? Yeah.,,,
4775,Gloria , You want to go to the pier today?,,,

4778,Manny ," Well, then, yeah, 'cause there's no place where I'm more at one with...",,,
4779,Jay , Just get your coat. ,,,
4780,Phil ," Okay. Let's do this, buddy. Okay, good recon. Got the lay of the land, so...",,,
4781,Luke , Aren't we going in?,,,
4782,Phil ," Yep. We are, but won't it be fun if we did it with ski goggles and barbecue tools?",,,
4783,Luke , I guess.,,,
4784,Phil ," Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.",,,
4785,Luke , All right.,,,
4786,Cameron ," Can I just say, that is a lovely outfit?",,,
4787,Dr Miura ," Oh, thank you.",,,
4788,Cameron ," Well, it's just nice to see you out of your lab coat. You actually have quite a nice figure.",,,
4789,Mitchell ," Take it down a notch. We're just trying to make a friend, not initiate a three-way.",,,
4790,Dr Miura , Lily looks great.,,,
4791,Cameron ," Do you think so? Shouldn't she have more teeth? I see these kids running around at the park, and they look like sharks.",,,
4792,Dr Miura ," Don't worry. She's perfect. Aren't you, Lily?",,,
4793,Mitchell ," Oh, look how calm she is with you. She's usually very fidgety around new people.",,,
4794,Cameron ," Well, I just think she senses you're gonna be a good friend for her during in good times and - and flu season.",,,
4795,Lily , Mommy!,,,
4796,Cameron , Did she just... did she just say... ,,,
4797,Alex , Are you nervous?,,,

4799,Alex , I was just asking. I'd be nervous if I were you.,,,
4800,Claire ," Alex, leave your sister alone. She's gonna be fine.",,,
4801,Haley , As long as I don't get the same guy. He's so mean!,,,
4802,Alex , You probably will.,,,
4803,Claire , You won't.,,,
4804,Haley , He hates me.,,,
4805,Claire , He doesn't hate you.,,,
4806,Haley , He yelled at me.,,,
4807,Alex , You drove into the bushes.  ,,,
4808,Haley ," Oh, no, it's him. Please don't be for me. Please don't be for me. Please don't be for me. Please don't be for me. Hi. Oh, thank god.",,,
4809,Driving Test Man ," Well, come on. I don't have all day.",,,
4810,Haley , I'm gonna throw up.,,,
4811,Claire ," Okay, no. This is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get in that car, put on your seat belt, And take three deep breaths and relax. This guy sees hundreds of kids every day. He probably doesn't even remember you, all right?",,,
4812,Haley , Okay. Okay.,,,
4813,Driving Test Man ," Yo! Let'move it, two strikes.",,,
4814,Claire ," That's more than three breaths, honey.",,,
4815,Phil ," See how much better this is? The truck goes in, it gets video, and then we get a preview of whatever's in there. How ingenious is that, huh",,,
4816,Luke , Are you too scared to go in?,,,
4817,Phil , Why would you say that?,,,
4818,Luke ," Well, when you stuck your head in, you screamed a little.",,,
4819,Phil ," I told you, that was the house settling. Besides, this is so much cooler. This is how NASA does it. Now, hand me the itty bitty booklight. Yeah. Final piece of the puzzle. Blast off!",,,
4820,Luke ," Hey, dad?",,,
4821,Phil , Yeah?,,,
4822,Luke , How are you supposed to steer if you don't know where you're going?,,,
4823,Phil ," Stay in the present, buddy. Got to do it by feel. You got to get all Jedi on it. Uh-oh.",,,
4824,Luke , Did you just lose my truck?,,,
4825,Phil , No.,,,
4826,Luke , You just lost my truck!,,,
4827,Phil ," No, I didn't!",,,
4828,Luke , That was my truck! Grandpa just gave it to me!,,,
4829,Phil , I told you to stay in the present!,,,
4830,Luke , Stop yelling! Truce?,,,
4831,Phil ," Yeah, sorry. ",,,
4832,Dr Miura , This is delicious.,,,
4833,Cameron ," Oh, thank you. The recipe's from the now-defunct gourmet magazine. Why do all the things I love go away?",,,
4834,Dr Miura ," Look, I don't even think she said the ""m"" word.",,,
4835,Cameron ," No, we heard it. It was clear as day. I-I just don't know what we've done wrong. I quit my job so I could stay at home with her, but maybe it's not enough. Maybe we're not providing her with the feminine energy that she needs.",,,
4836,Dr Miura ," Yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned about that.",,,
4837,Cameron ," You -- you know it's because you're Asian, right?",,,
4838,Mitchell , Cam!,,,
4839,Cameron ," No, I'm sorry. What, am I just supposed to ignore the giant panda in the room.",,,
4840,Dr Miura ," Pandas are from china. I -- well, it doesn't matter.",,,
4841,Mitchell ," Okay, okay, um, I think what my hysterical partner is just trying to say... And if I may... That for the first six months of her life. Lily was raised by very loving Asian women in an orphanage, with whom she clearly bonded, you know. And then suddenly you come in with all of your... Asian-ness and… and… and breasts and womb, lady bits, And it … it all just comes rushing back to… to her, And...",,,
4842,Dr Miura ," You guys are overreacting. I'm sure Lily just strung a couple of random syllables together and they happened to sound something like that word, But that's all.",,,
4843,Cameron , Do... do you really think that?,,,
4844,Mitchell ," Of course! Yeah, she... she's right. She's right. We're being ridiculous.",,,
4845,Cameron , We're being ridiculous. Your daddies are being ridiculous.,,,
4846,Lily , Mommy!,,,
4847,Cameron , Okay.,,,
4848,Dr Miura , Mr. Tucker?,,,

4852,Driver Test Man ," At the intersection, yeah.",,,
4853,Haley , Okay.,,,
4854,Driver Test Man , Left.,,,
4855,Haley , What?,,,
4856,Driver Test Man ," I said, ""left."" you're going right.",,,
4857,Haley ," Wait! No, wait! I'm trying, okay?!",,,
4858,Driver Test Man , Pull over.,,,
4859,Haley ," No, I can do this!",,,
4860,Driver Test Man , Pull over now! Why are you crying?,,,
4861,Haley , why do you hate me?,,,
4862,Driver Test Man ," Oh, hell. Haley, I don't hate you. You seem like a nice girl. You remind me of my daughter, which is why I want you to live a long and happy life and be safe, and not hurt my daughter.",,,
4863,Haley ," I really want my license. I've been practicing a lot, I swear.",,,
4864,Driver Test Man , You gonna drink and drive?,,,
4865,Haley ," No, sir.",,,
4866,Driver Test Man , You gonna text and drive?,,,
4867,Haley ," No, sir.",,,
4868,Driver Test Man , All right. Let's start this from the beginning.,,,
4869,Haley ," Could you smile first? I'll be less nervous if you smile. Okay, that didn't help.",,,
4870,Driver Test Man , Just go.,,,
4871,Manny ," Today feels like a good day for halibut. Hey, Jay, did I ever tell you about the time I used peanut butter and jelly for bait and I caught a thresher shark?",,,

4883,Jay , What? That's why we're here? But why didn't you let me in on your little plan?,,,
4884,Gloria , Because you're the worst liar. He would have seen right through you.,,,
4885,Manny , I don't want to go on the roller coaster.,,,
4886,Gloria ," Manny, you were afraid to light the barbecue, But now your eyebrows have grown back and your salmon is legendary.",,,
4887,Manny , What if I fall out?,,,
4888,Gloria , I will catch you.,,,

4904,Manny ," Well, if he's not going, I'm not going.",,,
4905,Gloria ," Oh, for god's sake, fine. I'll go alone. Here, take my girly purse. And you, my floppy hat. And if you need it, there's the ladies' room.",,,
4906,Manny ," I'm not man enough to fight this. Here, hold my purse.",,,
4907,Jay ," Oh, hell! ",,,
4908,Alex , What is taking them so long?,,,
4909,Claire ," I don't know. The only reason I'm not panicking is a giant geiser. You know, honey, I think I know why you don't want to go tonight.",,,

4919,Claire ," Sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl, someone will ask you to dance.",,,
4920,Alex , I know that. It's just stupid.,,,
4921,Claire , Somebody will ask you.,,,
4922,Alex , Why do you keep saying that?,,,
4923,Claire , Somebody will ask you.,,,
4924,Alex , But what if they don't?,,,
4925,Claire ," Honey, if they don't, then you do the exact same thing I told your sister, okay? Take three deep breaths and relax.",,,

4952,Dr Miura ," Guys, listen. I had a very complicated relationship with my mother. She was born in Japan crazy-traditional. She didn't want me to become a doctor.

4980,Manny , I did it! Whoo!,,,
4981,Phil ," Those are things you get over, But then there's our children. Will they fit in? Will they be safe? Those are fears you never get past. So, sometimes, all you can do is take a deep breath. Pull them close, and hope for the best.",,,

5069,Phil ," Actually, I was just checking on that. She's supposed to send me a message.",,,
5070,Claire , Ohh. You're Facebook friends.,,,
5071,Phil , Sure am. Oh... She's one of my 447 friends. Everybody wants a slice.,,,
5072,Claire , How long have you two been in touch with each other?,,,
5073,Phil ," Uh, she tracked me down about a year ago.",,,
5074,Claire ," Mm. Mm, mm.",,,
5075,Phil , What? What's... what's that sound?,,,
5076,Claire , Mm. Nothing.,,,
5077,Phil ," Oh. There she is right now. ""how about we meet at Le Reve",,,
5078,at 7,"30?"" ",,,
5079,Claire ," Well, that sounds innocent enough. I mean, drinks with an ex-girlfriend at an intimate French restaurant.",,,
5080,Phil ," Honey, you're doing that thing where you say what I want you to say but your tone seems mean.",,,
5081,Claire , Let me guess... Denise isn't married.,,,
5082,Phil , Recently divorced. What's the big deal?,,,
5083,Claire ," Come on, Phil. You can't be that naive. Seriously, women in their 30s on the internet are like... They're like ninjas. They get in their little black outfits and try and sneak their way into your marriage.",,,
5084,Phil , That's not Denise.,,,
5085,Claire , Mm.,,,
5086,Phil ," Here, read some of her messages. You're gonna feel silly. Go ahead.",,,
5087,Claire ," ""hey, Phil. How's it goin'?""",,,
5088,Phil ," You can't add the sexy voice. ""hi, Phil. How's it going?""",,,
5089,Claire ," ""so glad to hear your neck is better""",,,
5090,Phil , Are you seriously jealous?,,,
5091,Claire ," No! I am not jealous at all. I just happen to know women better than you do, and that woman wants a slice.",,,
5092,Phil ," Okay, just to prove how wrong you are, I'm gonna invite her over here for drinks.",,,
5093,Claire ," Fine with me. Just hope it's fine with Denise. ""gee, Phil. I really had my heart set on Le Reve.""",,,
5094,Phil , That voice doesn't bother me. Kind of like it!,,,
5095,Cameron ," Well, has he been acting weird around you?",,,
5096,Mitchell ," No, no. I've been avoiding him all morning.",,,
5097,Cameron , So you don't even know if he heard you.,,,
5098,Mitchell ," Well, that's why we're doing this. Hey, where are you? I only have a half-hour for lunch.",,,
5099,Cameron ," Hello, handsome.",,,
5100,Mitchell ," Okay, so, uh, this is where it happened. Just, um, turn off the phone, roll down the window, and we'll… we'll see if you can hear me. Okay.",,,
5101,Cameron , Go around! We're re-creating a faux pas! Thank you! ,,,
5102,Mitchell , Okay. C-can you hear me now?,,,
5103,Cameron ," Uh, yeah, but just barely. Is this how loud you were talking?",,,
5104,Mitchell ," Uh, well, it might have been a little bit louder. There was traffic. I mean, I almost had to shout.",,,
5105,Cameron , You almost had to what?,,,
5106,Mitchell , Shout.,,,
5107,Cameron , Little bit louder now.,,,
5108,Mitchell , Shout!,,,
5109,Cameron , Little bit louder now.,,,
5110,Mitchell , Shout!!,,,
5111,Cameron ," * hey, hey, hey, hey *",,,
5112,Mitchell ," Really, Cam? My job is at stake here and… Oh, w-who are we kidding? You can obviously hear me. I am so screwed.",,,
5113,Jay ," Manny? Manny, come here a second, pal.",,,
5114,Manny , Huh?,,,
5115,Jay ," I got some bad news, buddy.",,,
5116,Manny , What is it?,,,
5117,Jay ," Well, there's no easy way to say this. Shel Turtlestein is dead.",,,
5118,Manny , What? How?!,,,
5119,Jay ," I was down here reading the paper, And I heard this commotion up in your room, so... So naturally I go running up there. And this mangy raccoon had busted through your screen. He must have scampered up to where Shel was. By the time I walked in, he had him... The little bastard had him by the neck, shaking him. Gravel's flying everywhere. He didn't even flinch. He just stared at me with that smug look and then bolted. If only I'd have got here earlier.",,,
5120,Manny , May I see the body?,,,
5121,Gloria ," Baby, are you sure that's a good idea?",,,
5122,Manny , It's something I have to do. That's him.,,,
5123,Jay ," Sorry, pal.",,,
5124,Manny , It just doesn't make any sense.,,,
5125,Jay , Yep. Only the good die young. ,,,
5126,Manny , But in school we lead raccoons are nocturnal. They sleep during the day.,,,
5127,Jay ," They sure do, and this one must've got up for a midnight snack. You know, we've all done that.",,,
5128,Manny , I guess so. Yeah.,,,
5129,Jay , It all adds up.,,,
5130,Manny , I don't think I can be in here right now. Too many memories.,,,
5131,Jay , He'll be okay.,,,
5132,Gloria , You lie.,,,
5133,Jay , What?,,,
5134,Gloria , I'm Colombian. I know a fake crime scene when I see one!,,,
5135,Jay , I was hanging up the new poster. And it fell on top of him. It was an accident.,,,
5136,Gloria , You have to tell him.,,,
5137,Jay ," No. I've been through this before. When Mitchell was 9, I was supposed to take care of his bird. It got out and flew into a fan. It was like a bloody pillow fight.",,,
5138,Gloria , My god. How many pets have you killed?,,,
5139,Jay ," Just the two. I took the heat on the bird. It was a big mistake. To this day, Mitchell looks at me, I see him thinking, ""that's the guy who killed Fly-Za Minnelli.""",,,
5140,Gloria , And what if he finds out? Then what? You'll be the guy that killed his pet and lied to him.,,,
5141,Jay ," He's not gonna find out, because I covered my tracks.",,,
5142,Gloria , Okay. Fly-za Minnelli?,,,
5143,Jay , How did I not know that kid was gay?,,,
5144,Alex ," Hey, Luke! Big day for you, huh?",,,
5145,Luke , Why?,,,
5146,Alex , Because you get to meet your real mom.,,,
5147,Luke , What?,,,
5148,Alex ," We all made a pact we'd deny it until you turned 21, But that's the real reason dad's old girlfriend is coming over. She's your mom, and if she likes you, you'll go live with her.",,,
5149,Luke , I'm not adopted. I'm asking mom. ,,,
5150,Alex , You mean Mrs. Dunphy? She's not going to tell you the truth.,,,
5151,Luke , I-I-I'm not...,,,
5152,Alex , I know.,,,
5153,Luke , Unh!,,,
5154,Haley , Just 'cause he called you a dork-to-dork salesman?,,,
5155,Alex , The empire strikes back.,,,
5156,Manny , Raccoons have five toes.,,,
5157,Jay , What's that?,,,
5158,Manny , I don't mean to bother you. It's just confusing. The footprints in my room only have four toes.,,,
5159,Jay ," You know, I bet I know wt happened. I'll bet he lost those toes in a fight. And that guy looked like he'd been in a brawl or two.",,,
5160,Manny , One toe from each foot?,,,
5161,Jay ," Maybe. Y-you know, Manny, I think the only thing that's gonna get you to stop asking all these questions. is for you to have a little closure.",,,
5162,Manny , What do you mean?,,,
5163,Jay ," Well, I'd like to throw a little memorial for Shel. It'll be good for all of us. That way, we get our grief out, and then we never have to talk about this ever... ever again.",,,
5164,Phil ," Hi! Oh, careful, there's a thing. Ooh. That's a... good to see you.",,,
5165,Denise ," Hi! Hi! Oh, my gosh!",,,
5166,Claire ," Hi, I'm Claire. You must be D... o-kay. Whoa. Okay. Denise. Oh, and you're even prettier than the pictures that Phil's always posting.",,,
5167,Phil , Just a couple.,,,
5168,Denise , Shut up. Every week. He loves showing you off. My boyfriend likes your Acapulco pictures Probably a little too much.,,,
5169,Claire ," Well, thank your boyfriend for me. Sure. Come on in. Please.",,,
5170,Denise ," Oh, I brought you, um, Some lifting intensifier. Not that you need it. It's a limited edition, so... ",,,
5171,Claire , Thank you. Thank you.,,,
5172,Phil ," Oh, Denise, I think you might know these people. That's Haley... Hi. ...Alex, and...",,,
5173,Denise , Luke! Ohh! I had curly hair just like that when I was little.,,,
5174,Luke , So? That doesn't mean anything!,,,
5175,Claire ," Why don't we, uh, come on in, have a seat? Please.",,,
5176,Haley ," So, what was my dad like in high school?",,,
5177,Denise , Only the most amazing breakdancer ever.,,,
5178,Phil , Uh-oh. Don't fire it up. What? What? Uh-oh.,,,
5179,Denise , He had a boombox and a piece of cardboard in his locker. And what was your dance name?,,,
5180,Phil , O-zone. Yeah.,,,
5181,Denise ," I drove him to a ""star search"" audition.",,,
5182,Phil ," Which is totally political, by the way.",,,
5183,Haley , O-zone. That is dead-ass funny. I'm so calling you that.,,,
5184,Phil , Thank you.,,,
5185,Denise ," Wow. You really lucked out. You have a beautiful wife... a gorgeous house, and those kids. I could take Luke home with me.",,,
5186,Claire ," Well, be my guest. Seriously, you go right ahead.",,,
5187,Luke , No! I like it here! Unh!,,,
5188,Claire ," Alex, honey, will you go find out what's wrong with your brother?",,,
5189,Alex , Okay.,,,
5190,Denise ," You know, um, it's okay, I think I'm just gonna use the, um...",,,
5191,Claire ," Oh, yeah, of course. Down the hall, left-hand side. You can't miss it.",,,
5192,Denise , Thanks.,,,
5193,Claire ," Okay, she's fantastic.",,,
5194,Phil , Yes?,,,
5195,Claire , Yes. I feel awful. Who assumes the worst about people?,,,
5196,Phil , I first noticed it seven years...,,,
5197,Claire , You're not.,,,

5203,Denise ," I was thinking, too. Here... is my hotel-room key. You can come by whenever you want.",,,
5204,Mitchell ," It was funny that morning, huh? When I... when I pulled up next to you at that stoplight?",,,
5205,Mitchell’s boss , Funny?,,,
5206,Mitchell ," Yeah. Because I was on the phone with my partner, talking about how horrible his boss was -- his. And then, uh, you pull up, so...",,,
5207,Mitchell’s boss ," Anyway, I'm glad I ran into you. I'm getting worried they're gonna move up our court date. I-I need you to bust ass preparing. Because if they call us on Monday.... Uh, you need to get that?",,,

5209,Mitchell’s boss ," Yeah, they do that. It's a big day. Anyway, I need you here tomorrow. Now, I know it's a Sunday, but, uh, you think you can be on time, okay?",,,
5210,Mitchell ," Actually, um... I-I have plans tomorrow. Uh, so I won't be here. I-I have plans to stay at home with my family and do absolutely nothing, okay. But I will see you on Monday. Mm-hmm.",,,
5211,Mitchell’s boss ," So... so you're in charge now, is that it?",,,

5215,Manny ," ""Turtle. Reptile. Pet. Shel Turtlestein was many things."" I don't think I can do this without crying. Maybe we should just get to the cold cuts. ",,,
5216,Gloria ," But we want to hear it. Jay, why don't you read it? You were with him at the end. Remember?",,,
5217,Jay ," ""Shel Turtlestein was many things, but above all, he was my friend. When I didn't get a date with Fiona Gunderson, Shel was there. when I didn't get to play the part of Tevye, Shel was there. and when a raccoon broke into my room, unfortunately, Shel was there. I said a lot of things to my friend, but the one thing I never got to say was... Goodbye.""",,,
5218,Manny ,, Stop! I know what really happened.,,
5219,Jay , You do?,,,
5220,Manny ," I left a bag of chips near my bed. The raccoon must have smelled it. It's my fault he's dead. Sorry, Shel.",,,
5221,Gloria ," Jay, you don't have anything to say to Manny?",,,

5229,Claire , How's that?,,,
5230,Phil , She wants me.,,,
5231,Claire , To do what?,,,
5232,Phil , It. Her.,,,
5233,Claire ," Oh. Oh, this is because of the thing I said about Facebook and that everybody's hooking up, And now you're disappointed.",,,
5234,Phil , No. She bit the air right in front of me! Like that.,,,
5235,Claire , What?,,,
5236,Phil , And then look what she tried to give me.,,,
5237,Denise , Anything I can help with?,,,
5238,Claire ," No, I just... I can't find my corkscrew.",,,

5249,Phil , No!,,,
5250,Denise , I still have my cheerleader outfit.,,,
5251,Phil ," So do I, but this still can't happen. When did that break?",,,
5252,Denise , Why are you wussing out?!,,,
5253,Phil , I never wussed in!,,,
5254,Denise ," What about all those things you wrote on Facebook? ""how was your day? My neck is so sore.""",,,
5255,Phil , Why do people keep adding voices to these things? I didn't mean anything.,,,
5256,Denise , Are you telling me that I wasted a year of my life on this relationship?,,,
5257,Phil , What relationship?,,,
5258,Denise , How many other women have you led on?,,,
5259,Phil , Now I don't know!,,,
5260,Claire ," Phil? Phil, honey? Do you remember when you broke your arm when we were first dating?",,,

5271,Phil ," Okay, I know the pain is fresh, but the lie is really old.",,,
5272,Denise ," You know, this was a mistake. I'm gonna leave. Claire, if I were you, I would kick him out. Maybe he'd appreciate you more after he spent a lonely night in a hotel, at the Radisson, by the airport.",,,
5273,Cameron , You quit?!,,,
5274,Mitchell ," Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It was amazing. No, no, this is the new me, Cam. I am not letting people run my life anymore.",,,

5277,Cameron ," Because you followed your heart, and that is worth celebrating.",,,
5278,Mitchell ," Cam, I just feel...",,,
5279,Cameron , ha-ha!,,,
5280,Mitchell , ... so liberated.,,,
5281,Cameron , Hey!,,,
5282,Mitchell , And I'm not picking it up.,,,
5283,Cameron , Ooh! I like this guy!,,,
5284,Mitchell ," I do, too. I mean, y-yes, we'll have to... We'll have to cut back a little bit. But isn't it worth it if you feel like you're living your life for the first time?",,,
5285,Cameron , Totally.,,,
5286,Mitchell ," Oh. What were we even waiting for? You will go back to teaching music, And then I'll -- I'll just find something in a few months! And until then, all we need to do is just sit back and watch this little miracle here dazzle us. I'm tingling.",,,
5287,Cameron ," I am, too.",,,
5288,Mitchell ," It's like my heart is full for the first time in forever. Oh, god, it's really pounding. It's like I feel the weight of endless  possibilities just sitting on my chest. She is not doing anything, Cam.",,,
5289,Cameron ," You're not panicking, are you?",,,
5290,Mitchell , Of course I am panicking!,,,
5291,Cameron ," No! Don't panic. If you panic, I panic!",,,

5293,Cameron ," Oh, my god, Mitchell, I am used to nice things! What are we gonna do?!",,,
5294,Mitchell ," Okay, no, no, just calm... calm down. This is what we're gonna do. I am going to... I'm gonna do what I'm trained to do. I am going to lie, grovel, debase myself until I get what I want. I am a lawyer, damn it.",,,
5295,Cameron , Mitchell! No.,,,
5296,Mitchell ," Oh, no, you're right -- the tie.",,,
5297,Cameron ," No, we'll... we'll find something better for you, Something that works for all of us.",,,
5298,Mitchell ," There's no plan ""B"" here, Cam. We have a mortgage. We have... We have a... a child to support. I...",,,
5299,Cameron ," Hey. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna figure it out. I just want you to be happy, and you will be happy. And that is something worth toasting.",,,
5300,Mitchell , Let's just drink the cheap stuff 'cause we might have to sell that bottle.,,,
5301,Gloria ," It's hard to sleep in a bed of lies, isn't it, Jay?",,,
5302,Jay , Kids get over these things pretty quick. He's probably sleeping like a baby right now.,,,
5303,Gloria , I'm sure he's wide awake... full of guilt.,,,
5304,Jay ," Well, I'm going to sleep. Damn it!",,,
5305,Manny ," Hello, Jay.",,,
5306,Jay , What are you doing up?,,,
5307,Manny ," Waiting. Waiting for what? The truth. It wasn't a raccoon, was it?",,,
5308,Jay ," Oh, all right, you got me. I killed Shel. All right? I'm sorry. It was an accident. ",,,
5309,Manny , Why didn't you just tell me?,,,
5310,Jay , Cause I didn't want you to be upset with me. You and I got off to a rocky start. But lately it's been pretty good. I was afraid I'd mess all that up If you knew that I was the one that killed your pet.,,,
5311,Manny , Now you're the guy who killed my pet and made a stupid lie about it.,,,
5312,Jay ," Well, I don't think it was stupid. I thought it was pretty clever. Look, I s just trying to avoid past mistakes. Look... I know I can't make things all better right now.",,,
5313,Manny , Maybe.,,,
5314,Jay , Get some rest.,,,
5315,Manny , Since we're confessing things... You know that scratch on your car?,,,
5316,Jay , The one that can't be buffed out? Yeah.,,,
5317,Manny , You should probably know how it happened.,,,
5318,Jay , I know how it happened. Raccoon did it.,,,
5319,Manny ," Good night, Jay.",,,
5320,Jay ," Good night, kid.",,,
5321,Jay , Best thing I ever did was quit a miserable job and start my own business.,,,
5322,Mitchell ," Thanks, dad.",,,
5323,Jay ," Now, it's not gonna be easy, But that's why Gloria and I want to give you a little something to help you through it.",,,
5324,Mitchell ," No, dad, I can't.",,,
5325,Jay ," No, I want to, Mitch.",,,
5326,Mitchell ," Okay, but, I mean, a-as soon as I'm back on my feet, I-I really want to... Oh. Oh. Dad. No, you... You tried to give me this 20 years ago when my pet snake died.",,,
5327,Jay , I did?,,,
5328,Mitchell , Yes. Zsa-zsa Ga-Boa.,,,

5330,Gloria , And you really didn't know that he was gay?,,,
5331,Jay ," I must have, right?  Modern Family",,,
5332,Phil ," What's my favorite way to relax? Throw on my wireless headphones and disappear into the nature channel. The fascinating thing about nature is how, in the blink of an eye, it can go from a scene of total tranquil beauty to raw, primal violence.",,,
5333,Claire , Could you seriously not hear me with those things on?,,,
5334,Phil , It's noise-canceling technology. Give it a spin. It's got,,,
5335,Claire , Sweetie! Focus.,,,
5336,Haley ," Mom, why are you freaking out on everyone?",,,
5337,Claire ," Because you are acting very irresponsibly. All of you. Listen, honey, Luke has a giant project due tomorrow for school that he hasn't even started, And Haley just informed me she needs 40 cupcakes for her school fundraiser, also due tomorrow.",,,
5338,Alex , I'd like to point out I completed all my assignments on my own and on time.,,,
5339,Claire ," Not now, Alex.",,,

5342,Phil , Done.,,,
5343,Claire ," Okay, I need you to really stay on him, Keep him focused. All right.",,,
5344,Phil ," I'm...Actually gonna take a different approach, But...",,,
5345,Claire , Actually gonna insist that you don't.,,,
5346,Phil ," Claire, I know you've got your methods, but so do I. I'm sorry, but I'm not a cromanager. Trust me, I can provide Luke with the tools and guidance he needs without, uh, smothering him.",,,
5347,Claire ," You think I smother our child? Phil ! It's not your fault, honey. ""mother"" is part of the word. You never hear of anyone being ""sfathered"" to death.",,,
5348,Alex , I know what Luke's problem is. He's got ADHD.,,,
5349,Luke ," No. No, I don't! What is it?",,,
5350,Alex ," I'd tell you, but you'd wander of before I got to the ""h."" ",,,
5351,Claire , Just promise me that you will stay on him until this project is done.,,,
5352,Phil ," I will, but you might have a little more confidence in him.",,,
5353,Luke ," wah. Wah. No one can hear me now. Whoooo! Everybody is stupid, except me. Ha ha ha. I am funny. [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
5354,Cameron ," Is this the cutest thing I've ever seen? You out here on the curb With your little telescope, waiting for your dad.",,,
5355,Mitchell , It's not cute. It's… it's science.,,,
5356,Mitchell , Tonight is the magnificent lyrid meteor shower.,,,
5357,Cameron ," It's where the planet geek passes through the nerdy way. Oh, you know I think it's sweet. Every couple years, Mitchell and his father, they go out and enjoy one of these showers together.",,,
5358,Mitchell ," Well, I… I wouldn't necessarily put it that way. I mean, yes, me and my father enjoy it because we… we don't share a lot of the same interests. Like, um, I-I never went to sports games with him.",,,

5371,Cameron ," Uh, nervous? No, I'm...not nervous.",,,

5400,Claire , Okay.,,,
5401,Haley , Okay.,,,
5402,Claire , Okay.,,,
5403,Haley , My mom's not dumb. You can't just ask her to do something for you. You have to very carefully put the cheese in the trap.,,,

5414,Luke , I don't know. Mom usually tells me what to do.,,,
5415,Phil ," Join the club. I'm kidding. I love your mom. We are going to try a new approach this time. Now, your goal is to create a display about the life and art of Van Gogh, right?",,,
5416,Luke , Yeah.,,,
5417,Phil ," Okay, I got your poster board right here, So pretend you're telling the story of his life to someone who has never heard of him. What do you put on that board? I see the wheels spinning, the spark of creat...",,,

5431,Manny , Not if they see you first!,,,
5432,Jay ," Kind of missed with that one, kid.",,,

5434,Luke , What if we put all the sff about his life on this side and all the stuff about his paintings on this side?,,,
5435,Phil ," Luke, buddy, that's fantastic. And the best part is you came up with that by yourself. All it took was a little bit of focus and, uh...",,,
5436,Phil ," This thing is really loose. I'm gonna go grab a screwdriver, but you run with this. On your mark, get set, Van Gogh!",,,

5447,Mitchell ," You sure, dad? You're -- you're not worried I might stink up the blanket?",,,
5448,Jay , Don't worry about it. We just use it to cover up the seat for when Manny's all sweaty after his tango class.,,,
5449,Manny ," If you don't sweat, you're not doing it right. ",,,
5450,Waiter , Hello. ¿Como esta? Gloria! Desde hace mucho que no vienes.,,,

5467,Cameron , I'm fine.,,,
5468,Gloria , Are you sure?,,,
5469,Cameron , I love this place.,,,
5470,Gloria , But your head is running water.,,,
5471,Cameron ," No, I don't think it is.",,,
5472,Gloria , I told you it was too spicy for you! Look at your shirt!,,,
5473,Cameron ," No, I just need to get a little bit of a drink of something.",,,
5474,Gloria ," No, no, no, no, no. Cameron, the water makes it so worse. No!",,,
5475,Cameron ," Oh, you're right. That does make it worse. I feel like I ate the sun! ",,,
5476,Jay , Mitchell.,,,
5477,Mitchell ," Of course. What was I thinking? Dad, can we -- can we just go home, please?",,,
5478,Jay , You've got to air out first before I let you in that car. I'll never get the stink out.,,,
5479,Manny ," Hey, Jay, is that Venus? 'Cause I can smell the clouds of pure sulfuric acid from here. Slam!",,,
5480,Mitchell ," Okay, I-I -- I'd really like to go home now.",,,
5481,Manny , We'll miss the meteor shower.,,,
5482,Jay , The trouble is your clothes. Just take them off. I think there's a blanket in the trunk. ,,,
5483,Claire , And that is the secret to no lumps. See? It's kind of fun.,,,
5484,Haley ," You make it fun, mom.",,,
5485,Claire , Mmm.,,,
5486,Alex , Listen to these symptoms of ADHD and tell me it's not Luke.,,,

5496,Phil ," For your information, your son is hard at work on an awesome Van Gogh - got to fix that… masterpiece. Wait till you see. You're gonna be so surprised.",,,
5497,Claire ," Oh, god, honey, I want nothing more than to be surprised, really. Oh. I'm not surprised. Okay, that's it. I don't want to hear anything about your new method of doing things. There's one thing that works with these kids, And that is staying on top of them, Which, thanks to you, my friend, I will now be able to do all night long.",,,
5498,Phil ," Not happy, dude. You're supposed to be working.",,,
5499,Luke , I am working.,,,
5500,Phil , Mr Potato Head? Really?!,,,
5501,Luke ," I know what you think, but...",,,
5502,Phil ," No, I don't want to hear it. I'm going down to clean up the garage. Then I'm coming back, and I'm gonna stand over you Until this thing is done, okay?",,,
5503,Gloria , Breathe.,,,
5504,Cameron , Breathing only makes the fire spread.,,,
5505,Gloria ," Okay, then drink this milk. Ay, Cam! Why did you have to order that spicy dish?",,,
5506,Cameron ," Because I'm… I'm a big idiot. And I wanted to have this awesome night Between the two of us, Where we end up best friends, Uh, having lunch, buying shoes.",,,
5507,Gloria , Okay! Let's go have lunch! Let's go buy shoes!,,,
5508,Cameron , Really?,,,
5509,Gloria ," Yeah, why are you so surprised? ",,,
5510,Cameron ," I don't know. I guess I just always feel like I-I blow it with you, Gloria. Whether it's the Colombian comment Or picking the wrong restaurant…",,,
5511,Gloria , The restaurant? That had nothing to do with you. I was just not in the mood to go anywhere that fancy after the stupid thing I did this morning.,,,
5512,Cameron , What did you do?,,,
5513,Gloria , I bought a dress.,,,
5514,Cameron , You monster.,,,
5515,Gloria ," It was a very expensive dress that I don't need. I felt so stupid that when I got home, I couldn't even bring it inside the house. I left it in the car.",,,
5516,Cameron , I totally get it. I have a legendary hat story. I'll bet you look fabulous in that dress.,,,
5517,Gloria ," Yes, but anyone would look fabulous in at dress.",,,

5525,Mitchell ," Oh, come on. Where's the...",,,
5526,Jay ," I'm sorry if things got a little out of hand back there, But in our defense, look at you. I mean, smell you.",,,
5527,Mitchell , This is a fantastic apology.,,,
5528,Jay ," Oh, don't be too hard on the kid. I was egging him on. If you're gonna be mad, be mad at me.",,,
5529,Mitchell , Done.,,,
5530,Jay ," I was just happy to see him laugh a little bit. You know, he's had kind of a tough week.",,,
5531,Mitchell ," I got sprayed by a skunk, And I'm wearing a dress that makes my hips look huge. ",,,
5532,Jay ," I know he doesn't want me to talk about it, But he didn't get invited to this big party. Some kids he thought were his friends think he's weird. Now, you know me on this. I'm no -- I'm no good at it, you know? I-I never know what to say.",,,
5533,Mitchell ," Well, that's true.",,,
5534,Jay ," But maybe I raised a kid who would know what to say. Now, that's the only reason I invited him along, You know, because this astronomy stuff that's -- that's our thing.",,,
5535,Mitchell ," Yeah, no, I'll -- I'll talk to him.",,,
5536,Jay ," You know, you don't look that ridiculous. Now, you -- you actually got the legs for it.",,,
5537,Mitchell ,," No, I'm just saying, if you were that type of a gay...",,
5538,Mitchell , Dad!,,,
5539,Jay , ...You'd probably do all right for yourself.,,,
5540,Mitchell , Come on!,,,
5541,Cameron ," You know, I always had a sense it was dangerous down here, But I guess it's actually kind of charming, isn't it?",,,
5542,Gloria ," No, it's not safe at all. I used to live down here, you know?",,,
5543,Cameron , What?,,,
5544,Gloria ," Yeah, that's why I come down here. Look there. That was my old apartment. After I left Javier, that's all I could afford. It's still part of me. You have to remember those things. You do. Like you when you go to your farm.",,,
5545,Cameron , You remember that? I told you that a year ago.,,,
5546,Gloria ," Of course I do. You're my friend, you big idiot! You know, this part of town might be very rough, But the people here, Cameron... the best.",,,
5547,Cameron , I'm pretty sure I had wheels when I parked here.,,,
5548,Gloria , Ay-yi-yi! Who did this?!,,,
5549,Cameron ," Oh, no, it's okay, Gloria.",,,
5550,Gloria , Who did this? ! You coward sons of bitches!,,,

5557,Claire , Thank you.,,,
5558,Phil , And I'm really sorry for not underestimating Luke enough.,,,
5559,Claire ," Well, that means a lot to me.",,,
5560,Phil , The hardest part is he kind of takes after me with all this. Hmm. Like my lack of focus and your...,,,
5561,Claire , My what?,,,
5562,Phil , I just love you.,,,
5563,Claire , Hmm?,,,
5564,Luke , I did it.,,,
5565,Phil , Buddy!,,,
5566,Claire ," Oh, my god.",,,
5567,Luke , Do you like it?,,,
5568,Claire , I-I-I love it. Did you do this?,,,
5569,Phil , All him.,,,
5570,Luke ," I used Mr. Potato head ears Because Van Gogh cut his ear off. And there's money, because his paintings sell for, like, a bajillion dollars, Which is sad, because he died broke.",,,
5571,Claire , Yes. That... you were right.,,,
5572,Phil , Don't apologize.,,,
5573,Claire , I'm not apologizing.,,,

5587,Manny ," So, Jay told you?",,,
5588,Mitchell ," Yeah. Yeah, they would, um… they'd call me weird. I was weird… fun weird. But I… this is the funny thing about growing up. For years and years, everybody's desperately afraid to be different, you know, in any way. And then, suddenly, almost overnight. Everybody wants to be different. And that is where we win.",,,
5589,Manny , I'm sort of counting on that. I'm sorry I was picking on you too much.,,,

5614,Luke , My mouth is asleep like at the dentist.,,,
5615,Phil ," Get over here, buddy. ",,,
5616,Luke ," Why did he paint ""starry night""? Maybe 'cause the sky is beautiful And everybody likes looking at it.

5623,Claire , What's so great about that doohickey anyhow?,,,
5624,Phil ," ""Doohickey,"" Elly May? It's a movie theater, a library, and a music store all rolled into one awesome pad.",,,

5645,Gloria , He knows how to play. His father taught him how to play.,,,

5649,Gloria , You'd be surprised. Let him win!,,,
5650,Gloria ," Manny's an excellent player. But Jay is a grumpy loser. He mopes, he makes the face, he slams the door, then he said he didn't slam the door. It's better that he wins.",,,

5662,Jay ," Hey, buddy. I hope you're not upset about our chess match yesterday. What do you say we play again?",,,
5663,Manny , I'm good.,,,
5664,Jay , That's the spirit. Downloaded this for you. It's kind of a kid's guide to chess.,,,
5665,Manny ," No, Jay. I'm good.",,,
5666,Jay ," It's not all dry like that. They have fun with it. See, you can color in the little players with your crayons.",,,
5667,Manny , You are making me want to play again.,,,
5668,Jay ," We're lighting a fire. Let me toss this out. If you beat me, if that day should ever come, I'll give you, uh...",,,
5669,Manny , I want your watch.,,,
5670,Jay ," Wow. You had that loaded up, huh? Okay. Game on. Now, I want you to go first. Now, remember, try to open up the middle of the board. I'd have moved that guy two spaces. More aggressive. And you don't want to bring your queen out that quickly. You could have protected that with that, but now you're vulnerable to...",,,
5671,Manny , Checkmate.,,,
5672,Jay , What? How'd you do that?,,,
5673,Cameron , You will not believe what's going on at Jake and Debbie's house.,,,
5674,Mitchell , Who?,,,
5675,Cameron ," The people on the monitor. So much drama. Okay. Jake told Debbie that he had to work late, so she called his boss and found out that he didn't. Busted! So she spent all morning on the phone crying and crying to her mother and said if Jake has to work ""late"" one more time, she's filing for divorce. ",,,
5676,Mitchell , Huh.,,,
5677,Cameron ," That's it? I give you that tasty dish, and all you give me is a ""huh""?",,,
5678,Mitchell ," I'm s... Cam, I froze last night. I froze. I thought Lily was in danger, and I froze. But not you. You sprung right into action. You even had the cool ""It's go time"" line.",,,
5679,Cameron , That comes to me naturally. I spent a year as a crossing guard.,,,
5680,Mitchell ," What kind of parent am I if I can't even protect my own family? Just once I would love to be the guy with no fear who can stand up and... I don't know, you know, kick some ass.",,,
5681,Cameron , You're so cute when you're angry with your little fists. I just want to put you in my pocket.,,,
5682,Alex , I think he's coming.,,,
5683,Haley , Here he comes. Dad!,,,
5684,Kids , Happy birthday!,,,
5685,Phil ," You guys, that's awesome. Who are these from?",,,
5686,Alex , Cam and Mitchell.,,,
5687,Phil , Those guys are a class act.,,,
5688,Haley , We're making you breakfast. French waffle cakes.,,,
5689,Phil ," Let me guess. One waffle in between two pieces of French toast, wrapped in a pancake.",,,
5690,Haley , Nailed it.,,,
5691,Phil ," Bring it in here, monkeys. Love you! Get over here! Good enough.",,,
5692,Luke , Where's mom?,,,
5693,Phil ," You mean the greatest woman in the world? She is standing in line at the Apple store, making all my birthday wishes come true. Let's see how these bad boys taste. That is hot!",,,
5694,Luke , Are you okay?,,,
5695,Phil ," Fresh out of the oven, eh? That is...",,,
5696,Haley , Do you want some ice?,,,
5697,Phil ," Yes. Oh, man, this... Oh, that feels better. That feels better. No, it actually... feels weird. That burns in a different way! Don't wash this until we see if I can get my skin back, okay? ",,,
5698,Phil , Let me see it!,,,
5699,Claire , No! Your party's not until tonight. You'll have to wait.,,,
5700,Phil ," Just let me see the bag. Did you leave it in the car? Who'd you deal with? Was it a guy named Mehar? They call him ""the beast."" Tiny guy. He must move a ton of product. I kind of love that you're making me wait. You are the best wife ever! You are the best wife ever!",,,
5701,Claire ," I didn't get you the iPad. I got to the store, they were all out. I'm so sorry.",,,
5702,Phil , I don't understand. My online buddies got it. Sat800 and,,,
5703,Brobot didn't get there until 8,"00, and you definitely got there",,,
5704,"before 'em, because you got there at 6",30. You didn't get there at,,,
5705,6,30? Where were you?,,,
5706,Claire ,,00. Got up. Came downstairs. I fell asleep.,,
5707,Phil ," Oh, my goodness. What have I done? What have I done? I should've done this myself.",,,
5708,Claire , They're gonna get more in next week.,,,
5709,Phil ," Next week? That's, like, the worst thing you can say to an early adopter.",,,
5710,Claire , Where are you going?,,,
5711,Phil , To a place where birthdays still mean something.,,,
5712,Manny , I'll get that.,,,
5713,Mitchell , Hey Manny.,,,
5714,Manny ,,17 on a Saturday afternoon?,,
5715,Mitchell ," I'm just returning my dad's belt of tools, so...",,,
5716,Manny ,,17 on a Saturday afternoon?,,
5717,Jay ," Don't you have something better to do? So, were you a big hit?",,,
5718,Mitchell , What do you mean?,,,
5719,Jay ," Well, I just assumed it was some kind of costume party. Was Cam the Indian? ",,,
5720,Mitchell ," For your information, dad, we were doing a little construction at the house.",,,
5721,Jay , What did you build?,,,
5722,Mitchell , A gift-wrapping station.,,,
5723,Jay , And we're back.,,,
5724,Mitchell , So...,,,
5725,Jay , Thank you for that.,,,
5726,Mitchell ," You're welcome. Hey, uh, dad, do you remember when I was probably 11 and you were teaching me how to fight, and then I quit?",,,
5727,Jay ," You said everything you needed to learn, you'd learned from ""West Side Story."" How'd that work out for you?",,,
5728,Mitchell ," If I'm ever in a dance fight, I'll let you know. Is the offer, uh, still good?",,,
5729,Jay , What's the matter? You got problems with Cam?,,,
5730,Mitchell , No! Why would you say that?,,,
5731,Jay ," Come on. I mean, you know, sharing a room with a guy? I bunked with my brother. I know that can get pretty rough.",,,
5732,Mitchell ," I don't ""bunk"" with Cam. Dad, I just want to learn a little self-defense.",,,
5733,Jay , Show me what you remember.,,,
5734,Mitchell ," Right... right now? Gosh, uh... Thumbs out.",,,
5735,Jay , Thumbs... attaboy.,,,
5736,Mitchell ," That wasn't very pretty, was it?",,,
5737,Jay , You know what? Maybe it was a little too pretty. That's the thing.,,,
5738,Luke , Here it goes.,,,
5739,Alex ," Oh! Buddy, I think the problem is you're not jumping from high enough. You should get on top of the garage.",,,
5740,Claire ," Alex, stop trying to kill Luke. I need your help. We've got to find your dad one of those iPad thingies. So, Haley, text everyone you know. Alex, Facebook, chat, tweet, buzz, bling... Just do what you have to do. We have got to find one of these iPads, okay? Luke, that means stay out of everyone's way and stop inhaling the balloons. ",,,
5741,Luke , I'm not inhaling them.,,,
5742,Claire , Stop lying.,,,
5743,Luke , How did she know?,,,
5744,Phil ," Didn't your mama teach you never to take a ride from a stranger?! Got a little vacation time coming up? Have fun on the Moon! Not feeling too well lately? Maybe you should come see the doctor, and I'll... get rid of it!",,,
5745,Boy , What's that supposed to mean?,,,
5746,Voice ," Attention. If you're here for Phil's birthday party, they're gathering in the picnic area. Phil's birthday party.",,,
5747,Phil , My wife knew I'd be here. She put together a whole party for me.,,,
5748,Boy , Does that really make up for not getting an iPad?,,,
5749,Phil ," Don't make me sorry I shared that with you, okay? See you, fellas. Howdy do! I just heard the announcement for Phil's birthday party.",,,
5750,Girl , Phil? Yeah! It's right around the corner.,,,
5751,Phil , Awesome.,,,
5752,Girl , Have fun.,,,
5753,Phil ," Thank you. Thanks, milady.",,,
5754,Everybody ," Happy birthday, Phil!",,,
5755,Littl' Phil , This is awesome!,,,
5756,Jake ," Hello? No, I'm just putting the baby down.",,,
5757,Cameron , That's Jake. He's the one having an affair.,,,
5758,Jake ," I know. Yeah, I can do it tomorrow night. I'll just give my wife some excuse.",,,
5759,Cameron , Men are pigs.,,,
5760,Jake ," I don't really have a choice, do I? Yeah, you could not cheat on her. How about that?! Because it has to be a surprise. When she hears me speaking Italian to her grandmother, it'll be worth all this sneaking around.",,,
5761,Cameron ," Lily, I had it backwards. He's wonderful.",,,
5762,Jake , I'll just tell her I'm working late. ,,,
5763,Cameron ," No, Jake, don't do that! That's the worst thing you could do!",,,
5764,Jake , Buona notte.,,,
5765,Cameron ," Oh, no, what are we gonna do? We have to fix this.",,,
5766,Jay ," I'm gonna teach you a couple of basic Brazilian jujitsu moves. Now, just... Just attack me.",,,
5767,Mitchell , I'm sorry. What?,,,
5768,Jay ," Take any deep-seated anger you have, get a running start and come.",,,
5769,Mitchell , I don't have any deep-seated anger.,,,
5770,Jay ," Remember that Halloween when I wouldn't let you go as Olivia Newton-John? You see what I did? I used your momentum against you. Learned this from the Gracie brothers. It's called the lion killer, mata-leao. Try to get out. Try to get out. There, you see?",,,
5771,Mitchell , I can't.,,,
5772,Jay ," Yeah. Alright, now... impressive. The beauty of this is you don't have to make the first move. Chances are, your opponent's gonna be overconfident. He's gonna think you don't know a thing. Basically, he's being suckered into thinking... Manny, that little bastard. He hustled me. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Mitchell! All right, come on. Yeah, breathe. Attaboy.",,,
5773,Mitchell , What?,,,
5774,Jay , You all right? Come around.,,,
5775,Mitchell , Why am I on the floor?,,,
5776,Claire ," Haley, I just struck out again. Please tell me you have some good news.",,,
5777,Haley , The grove just got in a shipment. I'm texting you the directions now.,,,
5778,Claire ," Okay, that's good. That's good. That's good. I'm there. I'm on that.",,,
5779,Jay , That kid stole my watch.,,,
5780,Manny , What?,,,
5781,Jay , He hustled me at chess. ,,,
5782,Gloria , You promised you were gonna let him win.,,,
5783,Manny , I did the first time.,,,
5784,Jay ," Wait a minute. You're in on it, too?",,,
5785,Gloria , Go and get dressed for the party.,,,
5786,Many , Do I have time for a steam?,,,
5787,Gloria ," Yeah, but a quick one.",,,
5788,Manny , Okay.,,,
5789,Jay , Why would you tell him to lose to me?,,,
5790,Gloria ," 'Cause you're a baby if you don't win, with the kicking and the eyebrows and the angry eating of the sunflower seeds... Jay ; Actually, that's not true. I don't mind losing to a chess genius, which Manny obviously is.",,,
5791,Gloria , Chess genius? He's not even as good as I am.,,,
5792,Jay , You're not that good. I won on our honeymoon.,,,
5793,Gloria , Or did I let you win?,,,
5794,Jay , You didn't let me win.,,,
5795,Gloria ," Why would I sacrifice my queen for your pawn, Jay? Huh? Huh?",,,
5796,Jay , Stop saying that.,,,
5797,Claire ," Luke, honey, hi. What's going on?",,,
5798,Luke ," The guy came with Dad's cake, but just so you know, it's missing a piece.",,,
5799,Claire ," Did you take a bite out of your father's cake? Stop lying, Luke.",,,
5800,Luke ," I'm not lying. By the way, I used your credit card to pay him. Is that all right?",,,
5801,Claire ," Oh, no. That's fine. Whatever. That's why I left the wallet there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I left the wallet. I left the wa... your poor dad. All this running around, and he'll think nobody cares about him on his birthday.",,,
5802,Littl' Phil , More cake?,,,
5803,Phil ," Why not, little Phil? I got no place else to go. ",,,
5804,Cameron ," Sir. Sir. Sir, hi. Excuse me. Um, yes, I know this is highly unusual, but I need your help to save a marriage. A couple in this neighborhood is about to get a divorce for a simple misunderstanding. Their name is Jake and Debbie. And I know you've taken an oath to not tell people where other people live. I respect that, but we could work out some sort of super-secretive spy signal, where if you scratch your left ear, you know, maybe they live on the left, and your right ear, they live on...",,,
5805,Mail Man , They live right here.,,,
5806,Cameron , This conversation never happened.,,,
5807,Mitchell , Sorry.,,,
5808,Claire ," Oh! Thank God! Thank you, thank you.",,,
5809,Mitchell , Dad just put me to sleep.,,,
5810,Claire ," The hunting story? Oh, my gosh, no. you can't cut the line. Sorry.",,,
5811,Man , I was here.,,,
5812,Claire ," I've been here for an hour and a half. You haven't been, so you cut the line.",,,
5813,Man , Whatever.,,,
5814,Mitchell ," Excuse me, sir, you don't understand. You're not getting in front of us.",,,
5815,Man ," Calm down, gingerbread.",,,
5816,Mitchell , Are you gonna move or not? Then you leave me no choice.,,,
5817,Claire ," Oh, my God.",,,
5818,Mitchell , Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.,,,
5819,Man , No.,,,
5820,Mitchell , Go to sleep.,,,
5821,Claire , What are you doing? Get off of him.,,,
5822,Mitchell , Shut up. He's about to go to sleep.,,,
5823,Man , No.,,,
5824,Claire , Let's stop it.,,,
5825,Security ," You three, out of line.",,,
5826,Claire ," Sorry, I had nothing to do with this. I'm just waiting in line to get an iPad. I don't even know this guy. I need your credit card. ",,,
5827,Man , He's the problem.,,,
5828,Mitchell , Shut up. You're supposed to be asleep.,,,
5829,Claire , It's okay! I have it. I've got it.,,,
5830,Mitchell , What?,,,
5831,Claire ," I've got your card. I'm good. No, no, I'm good. No, I'm here... I've got to get my husband an iPad!",,,
5832,Phil ," Key to a good birthday... Low expectations. Thought I was getting an iPad. I was wrong about that. Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages. Sorry, big Phil. When it comes right down to it, we're Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.",,,
5833,Alex ," Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.",,,
5834,Phil , He won't.,,,
5835,Luke , And the pizzas never showed up.,,,
5836,Phil ," And they won't. Hey, balloons.",,,
5837,Gloria , Fine. I guess we'll never know.,,,
5838,Jay ," Or we can find out right now, huh? Manny, give me the chess set.",,,
5839,Phil ," Oh, it's a chess set.",,,
5840,Jay , Yeah. You'll get it later. We got something to settle. Go in there.,,,
5841,Gloria ," Happy birthday, Phil.",,,
5842,Manny ," Happy, happy. Is it Claire's baked brie I smell?",,,
5843,Mitchell ," Cam, you'll never believe what happened. Happy birthday, Phil.",,,
5844,Phil , Sure.,,,
5845,Mitchell , You'll never believe it. I got in trouble for fighting.,,,
5846,Cameron ," And we saved a marriage. Oh, well, this is the best day ever.",,,
5847,Mitchell , It really is.,,,
5848,Phil ," Ain't it, though? ",,,
5849,Jay ," Easy. You can't sing ""We are the champions""... without your queen.",,,
5850,Gloria ," Damn it! Listen, I lose, and I burn this house down! Ah, but look at this...",,,
5851,Jay ," Honey, honey, what are we doing? This is ridiculous. One of us will win the game, the other will feel lousy, we both lose.",,,
5852,Phil ," Yeah, just leave my birthday present on the floor.",,,
5853,Jay , That's my girl.,,,
5854,Jay , She had me. There was no way I could win. I knew it. I'm just glad she didn't know it yet.,,,
5855,Gloria ," Two moves, and then... I'm a very good chess player. But I'm a better wife.",,,
5856,Haley ," Hey, did you get it?",,,
5857,Claire , No. How's your dad?,,,
5858,Haley , Acting weird... er.,,,
5859,Phil ," Hey, wife.",,,
5860,Claire ," Honey. Hi. Um, listen. Yeah, Luke, hang on one second.",,,
5861,Phil ," Honey, it's okay. I don't feel things anymore.",,,
5862,Claire ," But, sweetie, I want you to feel...",,,
5863,Luke , Mom?,,,
5864,Claire ," Luke, just a second. Where are you going?",,,
5865,Phil , Just heading out to the yard to get a shovel for my cake.,,,
5866,Luke , Mom?,,,
5867,Claire ," Luke, what do you want?",,,
5868,Luke ," I went on Dad's computer, contacted some of his geek friends, told them that he was dying and his last wish was an iPad.",,,
5869,Claire , What have I told you about the...,,,
5870,Luke ," One of them felt so bad, they brought over an extra.",,,
5871,Claire ," Oh, my God. You got it, you beautiful little liar.",,,
5872,Luke , Here comes Dad. ,,,
5873,Gloria ," Look at this, papi! Huh?",,,
5874,Claire , Who wants some cake? ,,,
5875,Phil ," I used to, but I don't desire food any... Oh, my God! You got it! All this time, I said I didn't care, but I do care... I care so much!",,,
5876,Claire , Do you want to blow out the candles?,,,
5877,Phil , Yes.,,,
5878,Claire , Go on. Go.,,,
5879,Phil , It did not just do that!,,,
5880,Claire ," Yes, it did!",,,
5881,Phil , Honey! Who's ready for the first day of the rest of their lives?,,,
5882,Gloria ," Phil, happy birthday.",,,
5883,Phil , Look at this.,,,
5884,Gloria , Can I touch it?,,,
5885,Phil ," Yeah. Not so hard, but touch it. Touch it, but don't touch it. Touch it, but don't touch it.",,,
5886,Debbie , I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. I love you.,,,
5887,Jake , Thank God that guy came over. What did he say his name was?,,,
5888,Debbie , He didn't. Must be an angel.,,,
5889,Cameron , Did you hear that? I'm an angel.,,,
5890,Jake , Or some creepy perv.,,,
5891,Debbie ," Yeah, how did he know? Maybe I should call the police.",,,
5892,Jake , You should. I'm gonna call the police.,,,
5893,Cameron , And they lived happily ever after.,,,
5894,Mitchell ," No, Cam, where are you going? It was just getting good. I want... That's my program.",,,
5895,Phil , I love you.,,,
5896,Claire ," I love you, too, honey.",,,
5897,Phil ," Oh, okay!   Modern Family",,,
5898,Phil , Steaks will be ready in five minutes.,,,
5899,Jay , You're destroying those things.,,,

5902,Phil , Fun.,,,
5903,Claire , wow ! Hang on! Dinner's ready in five minutes.,,,
5904,Manny , They are deceptively hard. A curious mix of dance and strain.,,,
5905,Luke , You're making it lame again.,,,
5906,Manny , Sorry.,,,
5907,Gloria ," Ay, do mio, that coach! Claire I hate that guy.",,,
5908,Jay , He seems to have the kids motivated.,,,
5909,Claire ," Dad, you haven't seen him. He taunts the kids, he's abusive.",,,
5910,Gloria ," If this was a Columbian soccer league, a long time ago one of the kids would have taken that guy out and krrr!",,,
5911,Jay ," A coach is supposed to ride the kids hard! Phil, help me out here!",,,
5912,Phil , He's a mean man.,,,
5913,Jay ," Oh, you're such a woman!",,,
5914,Phil ," Come to the game, you'll see! This guy is a real motherscratcher. Pardon my language Gloria.",,,
5915,Claire , Gloria?,,,
5916,Phil ," He better cool it, or I'm gonna introduce him to the Captain and Tennille.",,,
5917,Cameron , sorry we're late. I was at work.,,,
5918,Mitchell ," Oh, he loves to say that.",,,
5919,Cameron , Happy barbecue.,,,

5921,Cameron ," Since Mitchell is between jobs... I've taken a part-time job at a greeting-card store, Which I love. Plus, with my discount, we're saving a fortune. ",,,
5922,Mitchell , How is spending a ton of money on greeting cards saving us a fortune?,,,
5923,Cameron , It's math.,,,
5924,Mitchell , It's really not.,,,
5925,Cameron , Look it up.,,,
5926,Mitchell ," $2.95, $2.95, $4.95...",,,
5927,Cameron ," 40% off, 40% off, 40% off....",,,
5928,Mitchell ," $2.95, $3.95, $2.95.",,,
5929,Jay ," Mitchell, I got this golf buddy of mine. Great guy. Super successful. You two should talk. It could mean a job for you.",,,
5930,Mitchell ," Oh, thanks, dad, but I'm... I'm not really looking for anything right now, but...",,,
5931,Cameron ," Yeah, that's right. With me bringing home the bacon, Mitchell doesn't have to rush into anything.",,,
5932,Jay ," Yeah, I know you have all that greeting-card screw-you money, But talk to the guy? He's expecting your call in the morning.",,,
5933,Mitchell ," Dad, I appreciate it, but in the future...",,,
5934,Jay ," Oh, I can't stand this.",,,
5935,Mitchell ," I am sorry, but...",,,
5936,Jay , No. Those steaks have been done for five minutes. I'm taking them off the grill.,,,
5937,Mitchell , I'm sorry. I-I know how it feels to have him stick his nose where it doesn't belong.,,,
5938,Phil ," No biggie. That's just Jay being Jay. But one day I'm gonna be a grandfather, and then everybody better hide their meat. [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
5939,Cameron ," Ooh, who's she?",,,
5940,Mitchell , I hate it when you do that.,,,
5941,Cameron , Who's he? It's Charlie Bingham. He's the guy that my dad wanted me to call. I googled him. Look.,,,
5942,Cameron ," Oh, he owns earthgear apparel? I have their ski pants.",,,
5943,Mitchell , Really? You don't - you don't ski. ,,,
5944,Cameron ," I have cargo pants, and I don't work at the docks.",,,
5945,Mitchell ," God, I feel like such a slacker. I mean, he has done so much for being so young. Okay, look, he's opened up a dozen environmental foundations and conservancies. Wow.",,,
5946,Cameron ," So, are you gonna - are you gonna call him?",,,
5947,Mitchell ," I don't know. I mean, you know, I-I sort of promised",,,
5948,myself and you that I'd take a little time off and -Cameron , And you are loving your time off.,,,
5949,Mitchell , Totally.,,,
5950,Mitchell ," I am losing my mind. As much as I love Lily, Which is, you know, more than life itself, I am… whew! Not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad. No. But I-it's Cameron's turn. It's Cameron's turn to be out in the world interacting with other grown-ups while I get to stay at home and plot the death of Dora the explorer. I'd like to fill her backpack with brick and throw her into candy-cane river.",,,
5951,Mitchell ," So, I don't know. Should I -- should I call him?",,,
5952,Cameron , I don't know. Maybe just to get your dad off your back.,,,
5953,Mitchell , Yeah.,,,
5954,Cameron ," You know, I mean... I mean, because the last thing I want for you is to take a job right now. I am loving our life.",,,
5955,Cameron ," I am in a really dark space. Being away from my Lily is literally torture. and I can't pressure Mitchell, but I really, really, really just want him to get a job so I can go back to being a stay-athome dad/trophy wife!",,,
5956,Coach ," Come on, ladies, move it! Goodness gracious! Turtles run faster! Come on! Could you run any slower? I dare you to run slower.",,,
5957,Gloria , You see?,,,
5958,Jay , He's just trying to light a fire.,,,
5959,Gloria ," No, I light him on fire.",,,

6278,Phil , This is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility.,,,
6279,Claire , That is exactly what you said about Luke's paper route. [OPENING CREDITS] ,,,
6280,Woman , Hello? Is anyone in there?,,,
6281,Ben , Red's a good color on you.,,,
6282,Woman , Aah!,,,
6283,Jay , It's just a movie.,,,
6284,Haley ," Oh, he's so cute!",,,
6285,Alex , Look at his little face.,,,
6286,Luke ," I always wanted a dog. Thanks, grandpa.",,,
6287,Claire ," Okay, but remember, having a dog is a major responsibility. Everyone in the family has to pitch in.",,,
6288,Dylan ," Can do, Mrs. D.",,,
6289,Claire ," Not you, Dylan.",,,
6290,Dylan ," Oh, phew. 'Cause I got a lot on my plate right now.",,,
6291,Phil ," Hey, look who's here. Uncle Cam.",,,
6292,Cameron," Hey, we heard about the new addition, And we had to come right over!",,,
6293,Frank ," Cameron, so good to see you again. Now, that is a shirt.",,,
6294,Cameron," Oh, well, thank you, Frank. I get them online. I'll send you a link.",,,
6295,Frank ," Oh, well, at home, I smoke sausages. I'll send you a link.",,,
6296,Phil , classic.,,,
6297,Frank , And this must be Lily.,,,
6298,Cameron," Oh, yes. She just couldn't wait to meet the new doggy. I think she's good right here. Let me get in there and get some of that dogginess. Oh, there it is.",,,
6299,Dylan ," Haley, I got to go.",,,
6300,Haley , What's wrong?,,,
6301,Dylan , That was Brian. He just quit the band.,,,
6302,Haley , What? Why?,,,
6303,Dylan , He's moving to Portland. His parents got back together.,,,
6304,Haley ," Oh, that sucks.",,,
6305,Dylan , I know. Now we're gonna have to cancel the gig tomorrow.,,,
6306,Haley , Maybe you can find another drummer.,,,
6307,Dylan ," No, I think it's too late for that now.",,,
6308,Cameron, I play drums. ,,,
6309,Dylan , Huh?,,,
6310,Cameron," Well, I mean, I haven't played in a while since Lily's come along, But if you're in a jam... I can jam.",,,
6311,Dylan ," Well, you know, I totally would, But I'm not sure we like the same sorts of music, you know?",,,
6312,Cameron," Oh, what, because I'm gay I'm just gonna want to play show tunes?",,,
6313,Dylan ," No, because you're old.",,,
6314,Cameron," Wow, that hurt more, Dylan.",,,
6315,Haley , Give him a chance. It's better than canceling.,,,
6316,Dylan ," You're right. Don't want to lose the deposit on that fog machine. Okay, let's do it.",,,
6317,Cameron," I used to be a music teacher, But I gave that up as soon as Lily came along.",,,
6318,Mitchell ," Yes, well, we just felt that it was really important that one of us stayed home to raise her, so...",,,
6319,Cameron," Yeah, and that's not a judgment on other people's choices. It's just that we happen to be a very traditional family.",,,
6320,Mitchell ," Yes, that's what the disabled lesbian shaman who blessed Lily's room said, too.",,,
6321,Jay ," How you doing, buddy? All right, relax.",,,
6322,Claire ," I'm telling you Phil, the man was crying.",,,
6323,Phil ," That is impossible. My dad is the happiest guy on earth. It probably just sounded like he was crying. Have you heard the noises he makes when he gets out of a chair? Claire ; No, I know what I heard. I think this has something to do with your mom.",,,
6324,Phil , What?,,,
6325,Claire ," Yeah, he came here alone. Think about it.",,,
6326,Phil , She's on a cruise.,,,
6327,Claire ," Yeah, and they never take separate vacations, so...",,,
6328,Phil ," No. No, if something was wrong, my dad would tell me about it. ",,,
6329,Claire ," No, Phil, he wouldn't, because you guys never actually talk about anything.",,,
6330,Phil , We talk all the time. He crank-calls me at work like three times a week.,,,
6331,Claire , Crank calls don't count.,,,
6332,Phil , It counts for fun.,,,
6333,Claire ," No, honestly, I think that you should find out what's going on with your dad.",,,
6334,Phil , It's going to be nothing. My dad isn't like your dad. There's nothing deep and dark inside. His hard candy Shell is just...Hiding more candy.,,,
6335,Alex , I think he wants to go out. Go boy.,,,
6336,Phil , Smart dog.,,,
6337,Claire ," I hate to break it to you, but I think all dogs can do that.",,,
6338,Luke , I'm gonna play outside. Ow! What happened?,,,
6339,Cameron," Okay, should I just play a little something?",,,
6340,Dylan ," Yeah, but, you know, if it doesn't work out, Don't feel bad.",,,
6341,Cameron," Well, hopefully this is... this is like riding a bicycle and will all come back to me. That's the loud one. So...Here we go. Hm.... Oh, silly me. I had the sticks in the wrong hands.",,,
6342,Dylan , Wow.,,,
6343,Neal ," Dude, you should label those sticks.",,,
6344,Manny , Is that the alarm? Has our perimeter been breached?,,,
6345,Jay , It's not the alarm. The doorbell won't stop ringing.,,,
6346,Manny , Maybe a demon is ringing it.,,,
6347,Jay , Not a demon.,,,
6348,Gloria , Ay! Who keeps ringing the doorbell?,,,
6349,Manny , We're pretty sure it's a demon.,,,
6350,Jay ," Oh, yeah? There. If it were a demon, it would keep on ringing.",,,
6351,Manny , Not if he's already inside. I'm getting a weapon.,,,
6352,Gloria ," What were you thinking? Who takes a little boy to a horror movie? That's loco, Jay.  Jay ; This is no big deal. You want scary? When I was his age, I lived through the Cuban missile crisis. I slept with a butter knife under my pillow in case I had to fight some soviet colonel.",,,
6353,Gloria , Why would they send a soviet colonel to get a little boy?,,,
6354,Jay , Because I could identify every commie plane.,,,
6355,Gloria , What are we talking about?,,,
6356,Jay ," Look, all I'm saying, being scared is part of growing up. Manny will get over this. It builds character.",,,
6357,Manny , I'll take the first watch. You two might as well get some rest. It's gonna be a long night.,,,
6358,Gloria , Character.,,,
6359,Phil , Dad?,,,
6360,Frank , Come on in. It's open.,,,
6361,Phil , Hey.,,,
6362,Frank , Don't tell me... you need a cup of sugar.,,,
6363,Phil ," Nah, just, uh... I was just wondering, I don't know, uh... anything on the old noodle?",,,
6364,Frank ," Other than a bad toupee? I'm kidding, of course. This is my real hair.",,,
6365,Phil ," Well, okay.",,,
6366,Frank , Wait a minute. I want task you something. Am I'm putting you in a bad position with this whole dog thing? Claire seemed a little...Put out.,,,
6367,Phil ," Oh, don't worry about it. Claire didn't like me at first, either.",,,
6368,Frank , I can't blame her. Dismissed.,,,
6369,Phil ," Oh, dad, um, you know what? I, uh... Claire saw something, and she'd kill me if I... if I didn't ask.",,,
6370,Frank , What is it?,,,
6371,Phil ," Would you wear pants to breakfast, for crying out loud?",,,
6372,Frank , You got me again. Right in the funny bone.,,,
6373,Phil , All right.,,,
6374,Claire ," Come on, Scout. Let go of it. No, no, no! Ugh! Dog. Look at this!",,,
6375,Phil , How did he get a hold of your bra? ,,,
6376,Claire ," Well, uh, we were out on a date, and he has a really nice car, so... how do you think? He got it out of the laundry basket. I can't take my eyes off that dog for a second.",,,
6377,Phil , Why don't you just keep him in the crate?,,,
6378,Claire , I tried that. He figured out how to get out. I thought you were dealing with your dad.,,,
6379,Phil ," Oh, yeah. I did. He's fine, so...",,,
6380,Claire ," Whoa, you got that from a two-minute conversation?",,,
6381,Phil ," I asked him point-blank if he was okay. He said he was, so I just... just swapped some jokes and moved on.",,,
6382,Claire ," Phil, the man needs more of a push than that.",,,
6383,Phil ," Look, if he wants to talk to me about it, he will. Geez, someone's panties are in a bunch.",,,
6384,Claire , I thought I was showing concern and...,,,
6385,Phil ," No, right there.",,,
6386,Claire ," Oh, my God. That damn dog.",,,
6387,Luke ," Guys, a little help. I have to go to the bathroom, And I'm not gonna do it in here.",,,
6388,Mitchell ," Hey, I got Chinese.",,,
6389,Craig , Sweet. I'm starving.,,,
6390,Mitchell ," Oh, we have guests.",,,
6391,Cameron," Yeah, hey. We were just having a little jam session. You know Dylan. This is Craig. This is Neal.",,,
6392,Mitchell , I'll always remember him as the stranger holding my baby. Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?,,,
6393,Cameron," Uh, yeah. Uh, hey, guys, let's... let's just take five.",,,
6394,Mitchell , what's up with you and Jump street?,,,
6395,Cameron," Oh. Oh, well, their drummer quit, And I'm gonna fill in for him tomorrow night.",,,
6396,Mitchell ," No, no. We have Pepper's après-ski fondue party tomorrow night, Cam.",,,
6397,Cameron," Oh, no.",,,
6398,Mitchell , So you'll just have to tell your band that they're gonna have to find someone else. ,,,
6399,Cameron," You know what? No, I'm not gonna let these fellas down. I made a commitment.",,,
6400,Mitchell ," You made two commitments, okay? And you know how Pepper is. Everything has to be perfect. He gets mad if you don't wear a big sweater.",,,
6401,Cameron," Yeah, I remember. I got so hot last year, I almost went facedown in the Gruyère.",,,
6402,Mitchell , So I'm going by myself. Is that what you're saying?,,,
6403,Cameron, I just feel like I kind of need this.,,,
6404,Mitchell , To round out your college applications?,,,
6405,Cameron," It's just that because I'm always home with Lily, I just feel like I'm going a little bit stir crazy. Look at the den. Every time I finish painting it, I start all over again. It's like the Golden Gate Bridge. I'm gonna go back to jamming.",,,
6406,Manny , Aah!,,,
6407,Jay ," Yeah, we got to fix this.",,,
6408,Jay ," Hey, what's with the big sweater at a concert? Is that a gay thing?",,,
6409,Mitchell ," No, dad, it's for my friend pepper's après-ski fondue... Yeah, yeah, it's a gay thing.",,,
6410,Claire , I hope they start soon. I don't think Scout likes to be left alone.,,,
6411,Phil , You love the dog.,,,
6412,Claire ," No, I don't love the dog. I love my couch, and the dog was looking at it like it was a giant sausage.",,,
6413,Frank ," Good news, you two. You're getting your driveway back. I'm hitting the open road in the morning.",,,
6414,Claire ," Oh, already?",,,
6415,Frank , Yeah.,,,
6416,Phil ," Anxious to get home and see mom, huh?",,,
6417,Frank ," No, I'm just gonna drive wherever the wind blows me, which is usually into the next lane.",,,
6418,Alex ," Can we get some sodas, grandpa?",,,
6419,Frank ," Okay, but just one. I'm driving. Come on. ",,,
6420,Phil , He's not going home? He's never been away from my mom for longer than a doctor's appointment.,,,
6421,Claire ," Honey, I know. I told you.",,,
6422,Phil , I always felt bad for people with emotionally distant fathers. It turns out I'm one of them. It's a miracle I didn't end up a stripper.,,,
6423,Dylan ," Hey, thanks, everybody, for coming out. These are some songs we wrote. 1, 2! 1, 2, 3! ♪ baby, don't leave me ♪ ♪ I just, I want you to know ♪ ♪ I want you to know ♪ ♪ there's something inside me that I cannot control ♪ ♪ I cannot control ♪",,,
6424,Haley , Our boyfriends totally rock!,,,
6425,Mitchell ," I know, right?!",,,
6426,Mitchell ," Well, the plan was to watch him for 10 minutes and then run out to Pepper's party. ♪ ...My veins ♪ ♪ my blood runs... ♪",,,
6427,Mitchell ," But he was so great up there, how… how could I leave? ♪ but don't be afraid ♪ ♪ I'll be your vampire ♪",,,
6428,Mitchell , It was his moment.,,,
6429,Dylan , Come on!,,,
6430,Mitchell , Wow! ,,,

6432,Mitchell ," And his moment went on for a really... really long time. Turns out, I could have run to the party and made it back for the end... of his moment.",,,
6433,Gloria ," Manny, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed, okay?",,,
6434,Jay , Your bed.,,,
6435,Manny , Can I watch TV?,,,
6436,Gloria , Only 10 minutes.,,,
6437,Manny , Okay.,,,
6438,Ben ," Hey, Jay, it's Ben Dugan. I got your message. Uh, yes, I'm happy to help out. I'll swing by tonight.",,,
6439,Gloria , What's that?,,,
6440,Jay ," That's Ben. That's the guy who was in the movie. I figured when Manny sees him, sees how nice he is. He'll realize it's all pretend.",,,
6441,Gloria , You think that will work?,,,
6442,Jay , That guy's a sweetheart. Manny's gonna spend two minutes with him. He'll explain how the movie's made. He's even bringing his fake machete. Thing's made of rubber.,,,
6443,Ben ," Hey, are you Manny? I'm here for you! Look what I got.",,,

6450,Cameron," I thought the gig was a little sloppy in spots, but I think once I learn all the songs...",,,
6451,Mitchell , I thought... I thought this was a one-time thing.,,,
6452,Cameron, Are you kidding? We destroyed in there. Did you hear that one lady screaming my name?,,,
6453,Mitchell , That was Phil. He had a red bull. ,,,
6454,Cameron," Hey, guys, good gig, huh?",,,
6455,Dylan ," Yeah, totally awesome.",,,
6456,Cameron, Heck of a gig.,,,
6457,Brian ," Hey, guys.",,,

6466,Frank , I wish I could take you with me.,,,
6467,Alex ," Yeah, drive safe, grandpa.",,,

6474,Frank , Sure.,,,
6475,Claire , Guys.,,,
6476,Phil , I don't think you're being honest with me. I-I know something is going on with you. What's up?,,,

6484,Phil ," Oh, my God! Who is she?",,,
6485,Frank , He.,,,
6486,Phil , What?,,,
6487,Frank ," It's that little guy right over there. Come on over here. Come on. Come on. There you go. Oh, look at him. Driving across country, this little bastard nuzzled his way right into my heart. Didn't you?",,,
6488,Phil ," So, this is just about you not wanting to leave the dog? Well, you should tell mom.",,,
6489,Frank , Those three days on the road with him were the happiest of my life.,,,
6490,Phil , You should leave that part out.,,,
6491,Luke , I don't want to keep Scout if it makes grandpa sad.,,,
6492,Claire ," Yeah, I know, sweetie, but grandma has allergies, so Scout has to stay with us.",,,
6493,Phil ," Well, she could always just get some allergy shots.",,,
6494,Claire ," Honey, you don't want to put her through that.",,,

6581,Cameron ," Not for an hour, And this is the only time Jasper could do it.",,,

6641,Claire , What's that?,,,
6642,Luke ," If the plane flew into a storm and crash-landed onto an island like in Lost""! ",,,
6643,Cameron , Nobody likes a crying baby on a flight. It's... it's very stressful.,,,
6644,Mitchell ," Yeah, uh, last year, I flew back from New York. Next to a baby who was very upset the entire flight.",,,
6645,Cameron ," I was on that flight with you, and I don't recall... Oh, I get it. You're talking about me. That's very funny.",,,
6646,Mitchell ," Yeah, we couldn't get tickets to ""Billy Elliot"" all he wanted to do was dance.",,,
6647,Cameron , And that's my story.,,,
6648,Mitchell ," Yeah, five hours of this.",,,
6649,Cameron , I just want to dance at the ballet! ,,,
6650,Cameron , Ow. Ow. Ow.,,,
6651,Jay ," Something wrong there, Cam?",,,
6652,Cameron ," Oh, well, I'm just breaking in a new pair of hiking shoes. This always happens. All the men in my family have wide ankles. I have an Uncle that can only wear bell bottoms. Hand to God.",,,
6653,Jay ," I wasn't doubting you. Just, why are you wearing the hiking shoes?",,,
6654,Gloria , Surprise!,,,

6664,Cameron ," Oh, I'm just trying to keep her awake so she'll sleep on the plane. ",,,
6665,Cameron ," Dramamine... oh, I wish I had that the last time I flew. I'll tell you, the plane was rocking up and down, Back and forth. I thought the wings were gonna snap off, honestly.",,,
6666,Claire ," Okay, you do it yourself. Use your teeth.",,,
6667,Mitchell , I-is this the best way to go? What about the freeway?  ,,,
6668,Phil ," Relax, Pumpkin, I got this. It's all about knowing the route. You're talking to a guy who made his way through college by driving a pedicab. You know what one of those is?",,,
6669,Mitchell ," Yes, yes. I just saw one pass us.",,,
6670,Phil ," Quick, who sang ""Evil woman""?",,,
6671,Man , What?,,,
6672,Phil , Hello?,,,
6673,Claire ," Phil, where the hell are you?",,,
6674,Phil ," Uh...let's see. Oh, shoot, I just missed my turn.",,,

6676,Phil ," Well, I know, but Mitch...",,,
6677,Claire ," I was counting on you to be here, so, thanks... a lot.",,,

6680,Manny , Guess where the world's largest wind generator is.,,,
6681,Jay , Is it right behind me?,,,

6687,Gloria ," Ay, papi, don't say that.",,,
6688,Cameron ," Ow. Ow. Ow. Not yet, sweetie. Not yet.",,,
6689,Haley ," See, he's perfect. Look at him getting coffee and not putting chocolate in it. He's so mature.",,,
6690,Alex , What about Dylan?,,,
6691,Haley , Dylan's not that guy. ,,,
6692,Claire , Haley! Come on! We're leaving in two minutes! Get up!,,,
6693,Haley ," Oh, my God!",,,
6694,Dylan ," Oh, no. Is it tomorrow?",,,

6728,Phil , Yeah. You're pinching. You're pinching.,,,
6729,Mitchell ," Oh, I'm sorry.",,,
6730,Phil ," If you show enough houses, you learn all the tricks. Every Realtor is just a ninja in a blazer. The average burglar breaks in and leaves clues everywhere, but not me. I'm completely clueless.",,,
6731,Mitchell , Sure I'm not too heavy?,,,
6732,Phil ," Please, you weigh less than my paintball gear.",,,
6733,Mitchell ," Oh, okay. There we go.",,,

6746,Alex ," Look at him. He's sketching! He's like Leonardo DiCaprio in ""titanic."" I bet he goes to art school. Do you think he's sketching us?",,,
6747,Haley ," Yeah. ""us.""...",,,

6758,Security ," Excuse me, ma'am. Is this Manny Delgado?",,,
6759,Gloria , Yes.,,,
6760,Security , Your son's name is on a no-fly list.,,,
6761,Gloria ," Ay, please, we've been through this at the check-in. He's not the same Manny Delgado.",,,
6762,Manny , I'm just a boy trying to bring style back to travel.,,,
6763,Security , We just have a few questions to ask.,,,
6764,Gloria ," No, this is a mistake. Where is my husband?",,,
6765,Security ," Wait. Step this way, ma'am.",,,
6766,Gloria , Jay! ,,,
6767,Security ," Ma'am. Ma'am, step this way, please?",,,
6768,Gloria , Jay!,,,
6769,Security , Son? No pushing! Step this way.,,,
6770,Gloria , Jay!!,,,
6771,Jay , Could you make it a double? I'm traveling with my family.,,,
6772,Barman , No problem. ,,,
6773,Phil , That doesn't sound like him. You asked him to do something and he didn't do it?,,,
6774,Cameron ," But he never asked! I mean, all he said was, ""Lily's bag needs to be packed, and the newspaper needs to be canceled.""",,,
6775,Claire , That sounds to me like he was asking for help.,,,
6776,Phil , Sounds to me like you expected him to read your mind. ,,,
6777,Phil ," Yeah, life would be simpler if I was gay.",,,
6778,Mitchell , Do you think you could get in the fast lane?,,,
6779,Phil ," Oh, I could totally get in the fast lane.",,,
6780,Mitchell , I mean the road.,,,
6781,Phil ," Ooh, I'm getting a text. What does it say?",,,
6782,Mitchell ," Um Oh, g... well, it's nothing. It's the alarm company. It says your... your house was broken into.",,,
6783,Phil , What?!,,,
6784,Mitchell , It's nothing. They'll take care of it. Just drive!!,,,
6785,Phil , What happened?!,,,
6786,Cameron ," Okay, fun airport game.",,,
6787,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
6788,Cameron ," All right, you pick out a traveler... you come up with their entire story. Okay, this guy, his name's Henry. He's on his way to Phoenix to visit his grandmother, whose name is, uh... Unh! Pass. Too hard. Your turn.",,,
6789,Claire ," Okay, fine. I see a woman, uh, wracked with fear, whose husband has abandoned her.",,,
6790,Cameron , Where? Where? Who is she?,,,
6791,Claire , Me. I made it perfectly clear to Phil that I needed him here.,,,
6792,Cameron ," It's going around. Mitchell's mad at me, too. He thinks because I didn't help him pack this morning, He forgot his wallet.",,,
6793,Mitchell ," I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be snippy. It's just... I'm a little upset with Cam. I needed his help this morning, And, you know, he let me down. ",,,
6794,Cameron ," What am I, a psychic?",,,
6795,Claire ," No, it's not about reading minds. It's about knowing what your partner needs.",,,
6796,Phil ," Here's an idea. Just say, ""help me."" You don't even have to say ""me"" just ""help."" Then he'll know exactly what you want. You won't have to get all mad.",,,
6797,Mitchell ," I'm not mad. It's just... You know, you want to believe that you're on the same wavelength as someone, and then it's just... It's a little disheartening when you find out you're not. That's all.",,,
6798,Cameron ," What's frustrating is I would do anything for Mitchell, And... and, frankly, it's a little hurtful that he doesn't know that.",,,
6799,Haley ," So...Airports, huh?",,,
6800,Boy , Yeah.,,,
6801,Haley , Are you drawing something there?,,,
6802,Boy ," Eh, it's no good.",,,
6803,Haley , Tortured artist. Classic.,,,
6804,Boy , Oh. Yeah. It's a robot!,,,
6805,Haley ," Oh, yeah, sure is. What's behind him?",,,
6806,Boy , A dinosaur. It's for school. We're supposed to make a comic strip.,,,
6807,Haley ," We had to do that, too, back in the eighth...",,,
6808,Alex , He was 14 years old! ,,,
6809,Haley , Shut up.,,,
6810,Alex ," ""He's my soul mate.""",,,
6811,Voice , This is the final boarding announcement for...,,,
6812,Jay , Whatcha drinking?,,,
6813,Claire ," Dad. Hey. Mostly tonic, actually, thanks to my new sponsor here. I'm a little jittery about flying.",,,
6814,Jay , What are you talking about? You fly all the time.,,,
6815,Claire ," Yeah. I know. This started just in the last couple years. I think I'm just... I'm nervous 'cause I've got so much to lose now, you know? What about you?",,,
6816,Jay , I'm taking a break from my vacation.,,,
6817,Claire , We haven't even started yet.,,,
6818,Jay ," Well, I got to figure I might not have a lot of time for myself, You know, what with the luaus, the hiking, The talent shows.",,,
6819,Claire , Are you not happy that we're coming with you?,,,
6820,Jay , It's just not what I expected.,,,
6821,Claire ," But, dad... Doesn't it feel good to know that your whole family is willing to drop everything to be with you, to fly across the ocean in a steel coffin? I'm gonna finish that.",,,
6822,Jay , It's not you guys. I love the family.,,,
6823,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
6824,Jay , It just kinda feels like Gloria's going out of her way not to spend time with me.,,,
6825,Claire ," You don't believe that, do you? Oh, come on, dad. That is so crazy and so adorable. That woman loves you.",,,
6826,Jay ," Well, I didn't say I wasn't lovable.",,,
6827,Gloria , It's not every wife that would spend the money to fly a family to Hawaii.,,,
6828,Jay ," Okay, where does everybody think Gloria's money comes from?",,,
6829,Security ," So, what kind of business did you have in Japan?",,,
6830,Manny , I've never been to Japan.,,,
6831,Security , You didn't go to Osaka in November 2003,,,
6832,Manny , I was 4. ,,,
6833,Gloria ," Enough. Why don't you question the other people in the gate, huh? Did you see the old lady with the cane? What if she has a ceramic knife in there that can go through the metal detector? And yet you waste your time harassing a little kid!",,,
6834,Security ," Ma'am, you seem to know an awful lot about sneaking contraband onto a plane.",,,
6835,Gloria ," Yeah, I'm Colombian.",,,
6836,Security , Have you ever been to Japan?,,,
6837,Gloria , I would like to make a phone call.,,,
6838,Voice ," Ladies and gentlemen, pre-boarding for our flight to Maui Will begin in the next few minutes.",,,
6839,Claire ," Luke, please stop spinning.",,,

6845,Phil , Claire!,,,
6846,Claire ," Oh, my God, thank God you're here! Hi! Oh, honey. Mwah!",,,
6847,Mitchell , I am so sorry.,,,
6848,Claire , It was my fault.,,,
6849,Phil , It wasn't your fault.,,,
6850,Cameron , I should have known what you wanted.,,,
6851,Phil , Are you drunk?,,,
6852,Claire , Kinda.,,,
6853,Manny ," And once I spent a week in Cancún, which, by the way, did not live up to the hype.",,,
6854,Jay , Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on?,,,
6855,Security ," We're almost done here, sir. So you and your son are traveling together.",,,
6856,Gloria , Yes.,,,

6910,Luke , Who would we entertain?,,,
6911,Manny , I enticed some lovely tweens down by the kids club. Maybe we can find a nice spot near them by the pool and send over a couple of virgin mai tais. They may be interested in two sophisticated men like us.,,,

6926,Gloria ," Jay, I'm gonna go to the gym to work out a little bit. You want to come with me?",,,
6927,Jay , I just ordered an extra-long straw to avoid accidentally doing a sit-up.,,,
6928,Gloria , Mm.,,,
6929,Jay ," Ah, look at this. My brother. What's up, jackass?",,,
6930,Tommy ," Happy birthday, you dumb son of a bitch.",,,
6931,Jay ," Ha! My birthday's tomorrow, moron.",,,
6932,Gloria , I never understood this relationship.,,,
6933,Tommy ," So, 63, right?",,,
6934,Jay ," Hey, you can count.",,,
6935,Tommy , You know dad was 63 when he died. Huh? Hello?,,,
6936,Jay , Thanks for reminding me.,,,
6937,Tommy ," Ah, don't worry. He never took care of himself. He ate like crap and drank too much. So, anyway, Irene's begging me...",,,
6938,Jay ," Hey, Gloria, wait up. I'm comin'.",,,
6939,Phil , Hey. Hi.,,,
6940,Claire , Hi.,,,
6941,Phil ," So, I was thinking we book a couple's massage.",,,
6942,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
6943,Phil , I accidentally looked in on one. They seemed really relaxed until they noticed me.,,,
6944,Claire ," Haley, that's enough. Get off the phone. Luke! Pull up your trunks!",,,
6945,Phil , This bathing suit looks great on you.,,,
6946,Claire ," Thanks, sweetie. Haley, come on. Off the phone.",,,
6947,Haley , No way! Kira got her hair straightened?,,,
6948,Phil ," Claire, consider this a grand gesture of my love.",,,
6949,Haley , What are you... oh my god! What did you do?! ,,,
6950,Claire ," Phil, what are you thinking? That is an expensive cell phone.",,,
6951,Phil ," It's just the beginning. Buckle your seatbelt, lady. You're being wooed.",,,
6952,Phil ," In nature, fathers are known to eat their young. Is it because they're delicious? No. It's because they want to give their female... Bear, giraffe, what have you... the honeymoon they never had. Just to be clear, I'm not condoning eating your kids, but I sure as heck know why giraffes do it.",,,
6953,Claire , What?,,,
6954,Jay ," Come on, sleepy!",,,
6955,Gloria ," Ay, Jay!",,,
6956,Jay ," Come on, honey! Get out of bed! I just booked us on an outrigger.",,,
6957,Gloria , But it's your birthday. You don't want to sleep in?,,,
6958,Jay , Come on.,,,
6959,Gloria ," No, no.",,,
6960,Jay , I just came from the gym. Guess how much I benched?,,,
6961,Gloria , I don't know. 500 pounds.,,,
6962,Jay ," 500 pounds? What am I, a forklift?",,,
6963,Jay ," To tell you the truth, the call from my brother scared the hell out of me. I decided to get in better shape quick. Didn't want to end up like my old man. Although he did die doing what he loved... refusing service to hippies who came into his store.",,,
6964,Luke ," Manny's the worst roommate ever. Everything he finds, he folds.",,,
6965,Claire ," I know... sweetie, it's only for a few more days.",,,
6966,Luke , Last night we had a fire drill. Not the hotel. Just us.,,,
6967,Claire ," Hi, guys.",,,
6968,Everybody , Hey.,,,
6969,Phil ," So, what's today's big adventure? I'll bet the kids want to go with you. ",,,
6970,Mitchell ," Well, it is a big one the lavender ranch, Where they grow 45 different varieties of lavender. 45.",,,
6971,Phil ," You hear that, kids? 45 different varieties. Yeah, I can't sell that. Go with god.",,,
6972,Cameron ," Oh, well, more lavender for us.",,,
6973,Cameron ," When Mitchell and I first met, I may have exaggerated my interest in adventurous travel by implying that I had any. But it's one of the things he loves most about me, And I can't tell him the truth now. It would be like Lewis telling Clark That he didn't like to walk. Side note... We're very good friends with a couple named Lewis and Clark. Clark bought a big, sparkly belt in New Orleans that he calls his ""Louisiana purchase.""",,,
6974,Alex ," Mom, Haley keeps stealing my ipod.",,,
6975,Haley , All my music is on my phone. What else am I supposed to do?,,,
6976,Luke , Manny watches the news. You guys don't even watch the news.,,,
6977,Man ," Aloha. Hi. Sorry, folks. This pool is for adults only.",,,
6978,Alex , Aw.,,,
6979,Phil , Don't turn around.,,,
6980,Claire , What?,,,
6981,Phil , Trust me. Just keep walking.,,,
6982,Haley , Wait. Where are you guys going? Guys? What just happened?,,,
6983,Mitchell ," Ooh, so, we can drink lavender tea while eating lavender scones.",,,
6984,Cameron ," Oh, neat. So is this an all-day thing, or...",,,
6985,Mitchell ," Oh, no. I know what you're thinking, Cam. Don't worry - we'll still have time for the whaling village.",,,
6986,Cameron , Oh. Good. So...,,,
6987,Mitchell , Okay.,,,
6988,Cameron , I can't.,,,
6989,Mitchell , What? ,,,
6990,Cameron ," I-I don't want to go. I know I said I'm not a stay-by-thepool type of guy, but I really am, Mitchell.",,,
6991,Mitchell , What are you saying?,,,
6992,Cameron ," I'm saying that I like adventure, but not every minute of every day. Can you just go by yourself?",,,
6993,Mitchell , But the lavender ranch... It's... it's something two men are meant to do together.,,,
6994,Bus driver ," On or off, folks?",,,
6995,Mitchell ," Well, I'm on.",,,
6996,Cameron , I'm off.,,,
6997,Mitchell ," Think about what you're missing, Cam. It's an entire ranch full of lavender.",,,
6998,Cameron , You're not making the compeling case you think you are.,,,
6999,Jay ," Hey, you little monkeys! No standing around! There you go! Here goes another one! There you go! Here! Here comes another one! There you go! I thought you were one of ours.",,,
7000,Gloria ," Hey, Jay! Be careful. You're gonna hurt somebody...Like you.",,,
7001,Jay , Don't get too comfortable. I reserved us a tennis court.,,,
7002,Gloria , Yay.,,,
7003,Gloria , Thought that one of the advantages of marrying an older guy was that I was going to be able to relax. But all the swimming and running and rowing... It's just like how some of my relatives got into this country.,,,
7004,Phil , You know?,,,
7005,Claire , Hmm?,,,
7006,Phil , You look prettier now than the day we got married.,,,
7007,Claire ," Oh, honey, and you are even more handsome.",,,
7008,Phil , I did pushups in the bathroom.,,,
7009,Claire , you're funny.,,,
7010,Phil , You're nice.,,,
7011,Claire , I have always been nice. ,,,
7012,Phil , I've always been funny.,,,
7013,Claire , Well.,,,
7014,Haley , Mom? Dad?,,,
7015,Phil , Ignore her. That could be anyone.,,,
7016,Haley , Phil and Claire Dunphy?,,,
7017,Claire ," Yes, Haley? Honey, what is it?",,,
7018,Haley , I'm gonna go get some shaved ice at the hotel next door with some kids.,,,
7019,Claire , What kids?,,,
7020,Haley , Just some kids I met at the pool.,,,
7021,Claire ," Okay, I should go with her.",,,
7022,Phil ," Claire, no. You have to learn to let go. Turning a family vacation into a honeymoon takes commitment. You can do it. Eye of the tiger.",,,
7023,Haley , Hello?,,,
7024,Claire , I should at least meet them.,,,
7025,Phil , No. That is not eye of the tiger.,,,
7026,Claire ," Okay. Okay. All right, hey, honey. Go and have fun. And be back in time for your grandfather's birthday dinner, okay?",,,
7027,Haley , Thank you!,,,
7028,Claire , Okay! All right!,,,
7029,Phil ," Bye, honey.",,,
7030,Claire ," Oh, god. That feels weird and good all at once.",,,
7031,Phil , I know. I was leaning up against that nozzle a minute ago.,,,
7032,Mitchell , Hey.,,,
7033,Cameron ," Hey, you're back. How was it?",,,
7034,Mitchell ," Oh, Cameron, it was the most incredible thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Really? And you know who else was there? Who? Elton John. Yes, and he was so blown away by the beauty of it, He sat down at their lavender piano and played ""tiny dancer."" and we bonded, because he, too, likes adventure.",,,
7035,Cameron , Did that really happen?,,,
7036,Mitchell ," No, that didn't really happen. I'm just trying to get back at you for bailing on me.",,,
7037,Cameron ," I'm sorry! If it means anything, we've been relaxing here, doing nothing. Maybe you can join us tomorrow. ",,,
7038,Mitchell ," Oh, I-I can't. I just don't... I don't find relaxing that relaxing.",,,
7039,Cameron , I understand. You are who you are. Leilani.,,,
7040,Mitchell ," You know what? You know, I-I think it's because of my parents.",,,
7041,Cameron , It always is. Kipu.,,,
7042,Mitchell ," I mean, vacation with my mom and my dad Was them sitting around like statues When, you know, the only thing that me and Claire could do for excitement was... Oh... was, you know, sit around and listen to my skin sizzle.",,,
7043,Cameron , You poor thing. Sue.,,,
7044,Mitchell ," So that's like... that's why, when I'm on vacation, I want to go out and meet the locals. I want to immerse myself in the culture. You know, I don't want to sloth around all day... Ah, sweet Lady Gaga, that is good. Oh! Oh, thank you. Mmm! What's this called?",,,
7045,Cameron , Happiness.,,,
7046,Mitchell , Ohh.,,,
7047,Manny ," I'm curious. Is there any sand left on the beach, or did you bring it all up to our bathroom?",,,
7048,Luke ," Sorry, mom.",,,
7049,Manny , And now you're sitting on my linen jacket. I guess I can't have nice things.,,,
7050,Luke , Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was there.,,,
7051,Manny , It's okay. Oh! Luke! Stop! I'm wearing that tonight.,,,
7052,Luke , I'm wrinkling your linen! I'm wrinkling your linen!,,,
7053,Many ," Ooh! You know what? Out! I want you out! This isn't working! I don't care where you go, as long as you don't stay here!",,,
7054,Luke , What are you saying?,,,
7055,Manny ," What don't you understand about ""out""?",,,
7056,Luke , Fine. I'll just move in with my sisters. Ooh! Ooh!,,,
7057,Manny ," Oh, no. Who will pee all over the bathroom floor?",,,
7058,Luke , I was brushing my teeth at the same time. You try to do that! ,,,
7059,Cameron , What did you do today?,,,
7060,Mitchell , I napped.,,,
7061,Cameron , You did?,,,
7062,Mitchell , I haven't napped in years.,,,
7063,Cameron ," Yeah, it feels good, doesn't it?",,,
7064,Mitchell , Mm-hmm. Good and weird.,,,
7065,Cameron , Kind of like that one nozzle in the infinity pool.,,,
7066,Mitchell , I wouldn't know. Phil was hogging it.,,,
7067,Cameron ," Is it me, or is Lily more relaxed, too?",,,
7068,Mitchell ," Oh, yes. She is. I think it's because she's really picking up on our energy. You know, it's like, if we're tense, she's gonna be tense. And I think we need to bring this new energy home.",,,
7069,Cameron , It's gonna make us better parents. Lily! Oh! Oh! You let the...,,,
7070,Mitchell , What? What happened?,,,
7071,Cameron , You didn't bring her out!,,,
7072,Mitchell , I thought you had her. I thought you had her.,,,
7073,Phil , Come on. Let me paint you.,,,
7074,Claire ," Oh, sweetie, that is so creepy. Where is everyone?",,,
7075,Manny ," Okay, let me just say what everyone's thinking. My jacket's a mess. It wouldn't be, But someone used the iron to make grilled cheese.",,,
7076,Luke ," I had bread, I had cheese, and I had an iron. What was I supposed to do?",,,
7077,Phil ," Kids, kids... We don't care.",,,
7078,Gloria , Hola. Hola.,,,
7079,Claire , Hi.,,,
7080,Phil , Hey.,,,
7081,Gloria , I'm sorry I'm late. Where is Jay?,,,
7082,Claire , He's not with you?,,,
7083,Gloria ," No, he came down a long time ago.",,,
7084,Phil ," Oh, don't worry. I'll go have a look around.",,,
7085,Gloria ," Oh, he's probably in the ocean trying to pull a tugboat with his teeth. ",,,
7086,Claire ," Well, look who decided to join us. And where is your sister?",,,
7087,Alex , She is in our bathroom throwing up.,,,
7088,Claire ," Well, what happened?",,,
7089,Alex ," You're not going to like this as much as I do, but... She's drunk.",,,
7090,Claire , I knew I never should have let her go.,,,
7091,Gloria," Go, go!",,,
7092,Luke , That's awesome.,,,
7093,Manny , Guaranteed our bathroom is still messier.,,,
7094,Mitchell , Where is the elevator?,,,
7095,Cameron , Where?! I don't know! I'm taking the stairs!,,,
7096,Mitchell ," Lily, we're coming for you.",,,
7097,Phil ," Hey, you. Where you headed?",,,
7098,Claire ," Well, remember earlier, in the pool, when you convinced me to let Haley go next door With complete strangers?",,,
7099,Phil ," And you were totally on board, yeah.",,,
7100,Claire ," Mm-hmm, yeah, well, she got drunk, and now she's upstairs throwing up.",,,
7101,Phil , But she's just a kid. Who would serve her?,,,
7102,Claire ," We did, honey... on a silver platter. Look, you convinced me to relax and let go, and now this happens.",,,
7103,Phil ," I'm sorry, but we... we shouldn't feel bad about wanting a little time for ourselves.",,,
7104,Claire ," Sweetie, this isn't a honeymoon. We have kids. You have got to let this go. From now on, I am not losing sight of them for two seconds. Nothing gets past me.",,,
7105,Gloria , Did you find Jay? I'm getting worried.,,,
7106,Phil , I'm sorry. I have to deal with Haley.,,,
7107,Claire ," No. You know what, sweetie? I will deal with Haley. You go see if you can find dad.",,,
7108,Phil , I'll look for him out there.,,,
7109,Gloria ," Lily, where are you going, huh?",,,
7110,Claire ," Oh, my god. ",,,
7111,Haley ," I'm so sorry. Oh, my god.",,,
7112,Claire ," Wow, what were you thinking?",,,
7113,Haley ," One of the kids had an I.D., and she bought some drinks.",,,
7114,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
7115,Haley , I tried one and then another one. It was stupid.,,,
7116,Claire ," Yes. Yes, it was stupid. But you are really lucky that this did not end as badly as it could have. This is why we always say to you, ""when you drink, you make bad decisions.""",,,
7117,Haley , I know. I know. I just...,,,
7118,Claire ," One minute, you're having wine coolers at homecoming, and the next... The game of ""truth or Claire"" sweeps your high school.",,,
7119,Haley , Thanks for not yelling at me.,,,
7120,Claire ," Oh, honey... That would just be cruel. I'll wait till you feel better to yell.",,,
7121,Haley , I don't think I'll ever feel better. Does this happen every time you drink?,,,
7122,Claire ," Yes. Yes, it does.",,,
7123,Phil , Jay?,,,
7124,Jay , Over here.,,,
7125,Phil , Hey. Hey. What are you doing?,,,
7126,Jay , I'm stuck. I laid down. My back went out.,,,
7127,Phil ," Oh, well, don't you worry. We're gonna get you out of here. Grab on.",,,
7128,Jay ," You know, Phil, this might not be the best...",,,
7129,Phil ," No, no, no, no, no. I'm just gonna rock you. Like a hurricane. I'm kidding. You're too old to get that. Here we go.",,,
7130,Jay ," Wait, why don't you just get someone who works here?",,,
7131,Phil ," No, this is gonna work.",,,
7132,Jay ," And...Oh! Ooh, wow! It's spasming. Don't move. Don't move.",,,
7133,Phil , No. I don't want to get...,,,
7134,Jay , Um...,,,
7135,Phil ," By the way, I just want to thank you for this trip. It's really been the vacation of a lifetime.",,,
7136,Woman , Oh... ,,,
7137,Phil ," Nothing weird. Aloha. I keep my wallet in my front pocket, so that's... That's what that is.",,,
7138,Jay , Neck going...,,,
7139,Phil , I'm sorry.,,,
7140,Mitchell ," Anyone! Anyone, help!",,,
7141,Cameron , Security! Seal off the island!,,,
7142,Mitchell , This way. This way. Lily!,,,
7143,Cameron , Lily!,,,
7144,Gloria , you looking for someone?,,,
7145,Mitchell , Lily. We were so worried. We just got distracted. We're idiots.,,,
7146,Gloria , Ay. Don't beat yourself up. I used to lose Manny all the time. Now I lost your father. These things happen.,,,
7147,Cameron ," She's right, you know.",,,
7148,Mitchell , Did she say my father's missing?,,,
7149,Cameron , Hmm?,,,
7150,Phil ," We say we'll make time, but life gets in the way. I mean, I know we're parents, But can't we be lovers, too?",,,
7151,Jay , This may be my worst birthday ever.,,,
7152,Gloria , There you are.,,,
7153,Jay ," Oh, hi, honey. Hey.",,,
7154,Phil , He was stuck in a hammock. It was actually really funny. I was on top of him for like 20 minutes.,,,
7155,Jay , You need to go now.,,,
7156,Phil , Good night.,,,
7157,Jay , Honey. My back seized up.,,,
7158,Gloria ," Yeah, because you overdid it after that phone call about your father.",,,
7159,Jay ," I can't believe I'm as old as he was. Let me sit down here. You'd have liked him, my old man.",,,
7160,Gloria , I'm sure.,,,
7161,Jay , And he'd have loved you. My god. That guy was a charmer.,,,
7162,Gloria ," Mm, I know the type. ",,,
7163,Jay ," Yeah, we had a lot of fun. But I'll tell you something. Our family vacations were nothing like this here. One week a year in a rented cottage on lake erie, Spiders this big. I just wish he could have seen how things turned out.",,,
7164,Gloria ," Well, if you keep going like this, Maybe you can tell him yourself. Or I can tell him, because you're about to kill me, Jay. My legs, my arms, my back... everything is sore.",,,
7165,Jay ," So, I wore you out, huh?",,,
7166,Gloria ," Oh, no, no, no. Don't get cocky, old man. When I sit down, I can still get up.",,,
7167,Jay , Hey. Hey.,,,
7168,Gloria , Okay. Come on.,,,
7169,Jay , Come here. Come here.,,,
7170,Phil , The rest of the trip went better. Haley's room stopped spinning.,,,
7171,Claire , And the monkey?,,,
7172,Alex , There she is!,,,
7173,Claire ," Oh, honey. Do you want some eggs benedict? So creamy. No. No?",,,
7174,Haley , Mm.,,,
7175,Phil , Jay got back to the vacation he always wanted. And Mitch and Cam managed to do some sightseeing at a working banana plantation...,,,
7176,Mitchell , Lily!,,,
7177,Phil , ...Where they promptly lost Lily again.,,,
7178,Mitchell , Why did you dress her in jungle print?,,,
7179,Cameron , Because I thought it would be cute!,,,
7180,Mitchell , She's gonna think she's back in Vietnam.,,,
7181,Cameron ," Lily! Lily, honey!",,,
7182,Phil , Me and Claire? We... We had a great time. But we never did get that honeymoon.,,,
7183,Phil , I think I just expected a little too much from this vacation.,,,
7184,Claire , You were so sweet to try.,,,
7185,Phil ," It was dumb. Like you said, the thrill is gone. ",,,
7186,Claire , I never said that.,,,
7187,Phil ," No, it's over. But wait. Put a few seconds back on the clock. The kid still has a few moves.",,,
7188,Claire ," Oh, my god.",,,
7189,Phil , I figured out why we couldn't have a honeymoon. Because we never had a wedding.,,,
7190,Claire ," Oh, my god.",,,
7191,Phil , I still can't tell if you think this is lame or cool.,,,
7192,Claire , I think it's incredibly cool.,,,
7193,Jay , Looks like I finally get to walk you down the aisle.,,,
7194,Claire , Daddy!,,,
7195,Jay , Ow! You better walk me.,,,
7196,Claire , Okay. I'll try.,,,
7197,Minister ," We're here today to celebrate the renewing of the marriage vows of Phil and Claire. On this day, they've chosen to reaffirm their love for each other. You may kiss your bride.",,,
7198,Claire , Oh!,,,
7199,Minister ," I present to you, still as husband and wife, Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy.",,,
7200,Male voice , …Thank you for choose Continental Airlines. Good night from Maui to Los Angeles.,,,
7201,Claire ," Thank you. You know, honey, if anything were ever to happen to me, I would want you to get remarried.",,,
7202,Phil , Okay.,,,
7203,Claire , Mm. That was a little fast.,,,
7204,Phil ," Oh, no. I ju... I just want to make you happy.",,,
7205,Claire , Okay. Any idea of who you would marry if...,,,
7206,Phil ," Vicki Conroy, probably. She works in my office. She's very organized. The kids love her.",,,
7207,Alex , Are you guys talking about Vicki?,,,
7208,Phil , Yeah.,,,
7209,Alex ," Mom, she's awesome.",,,
7210,Phil ," Just so you know, if something were to happen to me, I...",,,
7211,Claire ," Oh, something's gonna happen to you, all right.  Modern Family",,,
7212,Claire ," Oh, hey! I had a great time at the game!",,,
7213,Phil , Thanks.,,,
7214,Claire , Mwa! Why are you... crunching?,,,
7215,Phil ," Ordinarily, I'm a rule follower, but when someone tells me I can't bring my own snacks into their stadium, that's when I get a little nuts. It's a free country, right? Let's just say it ruffles me... ...when some goobers... tell me I have to spend half my payday...On their hot dogs.",,,
7216,Claire ," Please, just remember the family portrait. We only have the photographer for an hour.",,,
7217,Phil , Okay.,,,
7218,Claire ," Okay? And, sweetie, did you have a chance to try on the white pants I put in your closet?",,,
7219,Phil ," Oh, what do they look like?",,,
7220,Claire ," Is there really a more clear way to describe white pants? Sweetie, if they don't fit you, you're gonna be the only one not wearing white, and then you're gonna stand out like ""where's Waldo?""",,,
7221,Phil ," Actually, ""where's Waldo?"" doesn't stand out. He's super hard to find. That's the challenge.",,,
7222,Claire , This portrait is incredibly important to me.,,,
7223,Phil ," Also, his name is just Waldo. Sorry.",,,
7224,Claire ," I spent weeks trying to find a time that works for everybody and finding the right photographer. So if you could just promise me that you'll cooperate, okay?",,,
7225,Phil , I promise.,,,
7226,Claire , Okay.,,,
7227,Phil , This is amazing that you're doing this.,,,
7228,Claire ," Mm, thank you.",,,
7229,Phil , You're wonderful.,,,
7230,Claire , Thank you. ,,,
7231,Phil , Get in here.,,,
7232,Claire , Okay.,,,
7233,Phil ," Oh, no can do.",,,
7234,Claire ,, Oh. Oh.,,
7235,Phil , I love you.,,,
7236,Claire , Bye.,,,
7237,Jay , Where's my good underwear?,,,
7238,Gloria ," The question is, why isn't all your underwear good, Jay? You make a nice living!",,,
7239,Jay , The new maid keeps mixing up my underwear with Manny's. Put on the first thing I grabbed... It was like a crotch tourniquet. You got to talk to her.,,,
7240,Gloria , Why me?,,,
7241,Jay , Hola. You both speak the same language.,,,
7242,Gloria , She's Portuguese. Do you know how offensive it is that you put all of us in the same mixing pot?,,,
7243,Jay , I'm sorry. Please apologize to her when you tell her not to put my underwear...,,,
7244,Gloria , I can't talk to her!,,,
7245,Jay ," Hey, guys.",,,
7246,Phil , Hey!,,,
7247,Jay , Where's Luke?,,,
7248,Alex , I'm going instead.,,,
7249,Phil , Luke suddenly remembered a school project due tomorrow.,,,
7250,Jay ," Oh, that's tough. But it's a good lesson for the kid. You know, you made a commitment, you got to follow through.",,,
7251,Phil , Yeah.,,,
7252,Gloria , What is the project?,,,
7253,Phil ," Uh, he has to interview somebody who lived through the 1960s.",,,
7254,Jay ," Oh, no. Hello. Yeah, Luke. Oh, sure, I remember what I said. Yeah, come on over. All right. Gloria, you're gonna have to take Manny to the game.",,,
7255,Gloria ," Yay. Manny, vamos! ",,,
7256,Manny ," I'm still getting dressed! Hey, mom! I think my diet's working! My underwear won't stay up! [OPENING CREDITS]",,,
7257,Mitchell ," Oh, so delicious. Yes. Hey, you're okay with me not going with you today, right?",,,
7258,Cameron , I have been hired to sing at a wedding this weekend. I was plucked from obscurity after a particularly stirring karaoke performance. So I guess you could say I'm a professional singer now.,,,
7259,Mitchell ," I don't know. Well, they're paying you in flowers, so...",,,
7260,Cameron ," Well, I would have blown the money on flowers anyway. They're saving me a step. Plus, all the great divas are rewarded in flowers.",,,
7261,Mitchell , They're also given paychecks.,,,
7262,Mitchell ," It's just, I'm really bad at small talk, so...",,,
7263,Cameron , I get it. It's not a problem.,,,
7264,Mitchell , Are you sure? Because you've been quiet all morning.,,,
7265,Cameron , It's because I'm resting my instrument.,,,
7266,Mitchell , Okay. I feel tension.,,,
7267,Everyone , Kobe!,,,
7268,Phil ," Hey, what can I do for you? Do you like being a basketball...Player?",,,
7269,Kobe , You serious?,,,
7270,Phil ," I choked. I didn't think you'd look up here, at me.",,,
7271,Kobe , Little preparation next time. It's a mental game.,,,
7272,Phil , Dually noted.,,,
7273,Haley , What's wrong?,,,
7274,Claire , That broken step. It's gonna ruin our whole family portrait. ,,,
7275,Claire ," Okay, here's my idea. I'm really excited about it. The whole extended family, all dressed in white, in a single-file line down the staircase.",,,
7276,Phil ," Oh, like a line on the highway.",,,
7277,Claire , No.,,,
7278,Phil , Or a-a ski jump.,,,
7279,Claire , No. Why... why would I want a ski jump?,,,
7280,Phil ," I don't know. My idea was to have the whole family on a giant bed like in ""Willy Wonka.""",,,
7281,Claire ," Yeah, but that's ridiculous.",,,
7282,Phil , Ridicu-licious.,,,
7283,Haley , I don't see anything.,,,
7284,Claire , So I'm crazy?,,,
7285,Haley , No! You're...not.,,,
7286,Claire , Your father was supposed to fix that step.,,,
7287,Haley ," Mom, you're obsessing over the tiniest little thing.",,,
7288,Claire , So you do see it.,,,
7289,Haley , Yeah. What is the big deal about this one picture?,,,
7290,Claire ," Honey, you know what? I don't expect you to understand. But all right. When you're a mom, everything goes by so quickly. in a minute, Luke's gonna be shaving, And Alex is gonna be off at college, And... and you're gonna be... you're gonna be doing something great. Just want to freeze this moment as it is right now. You know?",,,
7291,Haley ," I do. I know I don't show it, but this family's still the most important thing that I... screw it.",,,
7292,Claire ," I'm gonna fix the bastard. I mean, seriously, how hard can it be? If your father can do it, I can do it, right? All right. I just need to... like, lift...",,,
7293,Haley , Oh. Now I see it.,,,
7294,Claire , Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.,,,
7295,Phil , These seats are amazing!,,,
7296,Gloria , Why you have candy coming out of your pants?,,,
7297,Phil ," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. ",,,
7298,Gloria , Huh?,,,
7299,Phil ," I brought my own snacks. Not because I'm cheap. It's. Plus, I get a little rush from the danger. Be cool! Be cool! Be cool! Just look straight ahead. I've never felt more alive. Whoo! ",,,
7300,Cameron ," You're gonna be fine, Mitchell. You know what? Just as long as you don't... Oh, you know what? They're starting. I got to go. Okay. Bye.",,,
7301,Mitchell ," As long as I don't what?! Cam, as long as I don't... Oh! ",,,
7302,Claire ," Okay, I just made it worse. I'm not freaking out, though. I'm gonna call your dad, And he's gonna tell me how to fix this.",,,
7303,Haley ," ""Oh, my God, it's dad""",,,
7304,Claire , Where?,,,
7305,Haley ," Right there, behind Kobe!",,,
7306,Claire , Oh!,,,
7307,Haley ," Oh, how weird is this?",,,
7308,Claire , Quick. Quick. Tell me something to say that'll freak him out.,,,
7309,Haley , Tell him I'm pregnant!,,,
7310,Claire ," No, I'm not gonna say that. Okay, here we go. How funny is this?",,,
7311,Phil ," Hey, it's Phil. You know what to do.",,,
7312,Haley ," Well, that was pretty funny.",,,
7313,Mitchell ," Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! ",,,
7314,Manny ," Ooh, the kiss Cam! Wouldn't it be embarrassing if the camera was on us and then the crowd started...",,,
7315,Alex , We're related.,,,
7316,Manny , Not by blood.,,,
7317,Alex ," Touch me, and there will be blood.",,,
7318,Phil , Not us.,,,
7319,Gloria , What's wrong with you?,,,
7320,Phil ," It's the kiss-cam... When it lands on you, you're supposed to kiss. It's my wife's dad's second wife, so, legally okay, but still weird. That was awkward. And...we're back.",,,
7321,Gloria ," Ay, come on. It's not a big deal. ",,,
7322,Cameron , Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry for that. Hello?,,,
7323,Mitchell , There is a pigeon in our house! What do I do? What do I do?,,,
7324,Cameron , Who is this?,,,
7325,Mitchell , Never funny. Not funny now.,,,
7326,Cameron ," Calm down. You know, I grew up around many animals. One time, a rooster attacked me, and my mom wrung its neck, and we had it for dinner.",,,
7327,Mitchell , Great time for an anecdote. Help me!,,,
7328,Cameron , It's more afraid of you than you are of it.,,,
7329,Mitchell , Pigeons aren't scared of anything. They stand on electrical wires. ,,,
7330,Claire ," Thank God for caller I.D. So you don't have to talk to your wife. Oh, we're gonna talk, mister. We're gonna talk and talk...",,,
7331,Alex , Dad! Mom saw you on TV! You're dead.,,,
7332,Phil , Here's the thing. The kiss-cam is only supposed to be for the enjoyment of the people at the game! They never show that on TV. What people do in the privacy of their own sports arena should be their own business.,,,
7333,Jay ," So, in '66, I worked at my grandfather's office-supply business. You know, your ink, your staples, your legal pads. Am I going too fast for you?",,,
7334,Luke , I fell asleep for second. Did you do anything interesting in the '60s?,,,
7335,Jay ," Well, one summer, I swept up hair at my other grandfather's barber shop.",,,
7336,Luke ," Ugh, you're killing me!",,,
7337,Jay , What do you want? ,,,
7338,Luke , I don't know. Brian Beckwith's grandfather marched on Washington.,,,
7339,Jay , Artie Beckwith? He couldn't walk two feet without complaining. He marched on Washington?,,,
7340,Luke , He told Brian he did. With Martin Luther king Jr.,,,
7341,Jay , Martin Luther king? Guess who cut his hair.,,,
7342,Luke , What?,,,
7343,Jay , Do you know who cut Martin Luther king Jr.'s hair? Neither does Luke's teacher.,,,
7344,Luke ," So, the barber shop was in Washington?",,,
7345,Jay , Okay.,,,
7346,Luke , Did you cut any other famous hair?,,,
7347,Jay ," Oh, yeah, the Kennedys, Richard Nixon, All the astronauts. How do you think buzz Aldrin got his nickname?",,,
7348,Luke , Awesome.,,,
7349,Mitchell ," *we love to play in Lily's room, we don't need any milk.* Okay, you know what, Lily? I am a man. I am going into the kitchen to get your milk. Whaaaaaaaaa! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ohh!",,,
7350,Cameron ,"*Ave Maria. Gratia plena. Maria, Gratia plena. Maria, Gratia plena. ave, ave Dominus. Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris ventris tui, Jesus, ave Maria*",,,
7351,Jay ," Then one day, Wilt Chamberlain shows up. He says, ""Can you take a little off the top for my friend here?"" And it's Elvis.",,,
7352,Luke , No way.,,,
7353,Jay , Greatest singer that ever lived... after Sinatra. I'll fight any man who says different.,,,
7354,Luke , My dad says the greatest singer who ever lived is Peabo Bryson.,,,
7355,Jay , Then I guess I got to fight your dad.,,,
7356,Luke , Yeah. I guess. ,,,
7357,Alex , Luke says grandpa wants to fight you.,,,
7358,Claire , Why does everything have to suck?!,,,
7359,Haley , Let's just do the picture another day. I think I'm getting a pimple.,,,
7360,Claire , No! Do you know how long it took me to book this photographer? Maybe by the fireplace.,,,
7361,Haley , Yeah. That's a classic old-person spot for a portrait.,,,
7362,Claire ," Yeah, if I'd ever bothered to paint that hideous Wall.",,,
7363,Phil ," Claire is a perfectionist, Which sometimes is a good thing, Like when it comes to picking a husband. Sometime it's a bad thing, Like when, uh, everyone else sees something beautiful, And all she sees is the teeny, tiny flaw.",,,
7364,Claire , No. No. No. Hi. My house is a disaster. Can we do this picture at your place?,,,
7365,Mitchell ," Yeah, yeah, that's... that's not gonna work.",,,
7366,Claire ," Maybe one more layer... and tight, really tight. Dad, can you call them again?",,,
7367,Jay , I just did. They're on their way. Game went into overtime.,,,
7368,Claire ," I know, but we're losing the light, And the photographer has got to get to a bar mitzvah in 10 minutes. Oh, red wine. Really? Now?",,,
7369,Jay ," You know, honey, I think you're getting a little too uptight about this.",,,
7370,Claire , Mm-hmm.,,,
7371,Luke ," It's hard to breathe. Oh, you're fine.",,,
7372,Jay , What'd you do to him? He's turning blue.,,,
7373,Claire ," Yeah, but his clothes will stay white.",,,
7374,Gloria , We're home!,,,
7375,Claire ," Oh, thank God!",,,
7376,Phil , Hello!,,,
7377,Gloria ," Manny, let's go change. Mwah!",,,
7378,Phil ," Hey. There's my beautiful wife. I know you're mad at me, and I know this foam finger can't map for everything... ",,,
7379,Claire ," Honey, you just go change, and we'll talk about what you did later.",,,
7380,Phil , Okay. Hey... Thank you so much for those tickets.,,,
7381,Jay , Gloria tells me you had a real good time.,,,
7382,Phil ," Not really. No, I didn't. God, I love your daughter. Ohh! I should... I should come by and kiss that step... fix that step.",,,
7383,Mitchell ," Ugh, you're acting like I wanted to destroy the house.",,,
7384,Cameron ," No, I just think it's odd that the majority of things you destroyed were sent to us by my mom.",,,
7385,Mitchell ," Oh, okay, okay, okay, So while I'm fighting off that filthy creature, I actually stop and say, ""oh, you know what? Here's the opportunity I've always been looking for ""To destroy our kitschiest objects.""",,,
7386,Cameron ," ""kitschiest""? Oh, she's gonna love that. You know, if you would have just come with me to the wedding, none of this would have happened.",,,
7387,Mitchell ," Okay, so you are angry.",,,
7388,Cameron ," Mitchell, I get it. You're terrified of small talk...and birds. You're just lucky that pigeon didn't want to chat you up about the weather. Hello, Jay.",,,
7389,Jay ," Hello, guys.",,,
7390,Claire ," Oh, God! Oh, you look like the guy from ""dance fever""!",,,
7391,Phil , Thank you.,,,
7392,Jay ," Deney Terrio. Cleveland, Ohio.",,,
7393,Claire ," Dad, really. That is not a compliment. That's why I wanted you to try those on earlier. Turn around.",,,
7394,Haley , The picture can't happen today. My pimple's getting worse.,,,
7395,Claire ," Oh, honey, I am so sorry. Can you stand?",,,
7396,Haley , Yeah?,,,
7397,Claire ," Well, then, the picture's happening.",,,
7398,Haley , It's all anybody's gonna see!,,,
7399,Claire , I wouldn't be so sure about that. Did you get a look at her dress?,,,
7400,Phil , What?! Why would I look at her dress? I love you!,,,
7401,Photographer ," Uh, Mrs. Dunphy. The sun is setting. ",,,
7402,Claire ," Oh, okay, yeah, this is happening. Everybody, come on, let's go.",,,
7403,Jay , Hold it. Be careful. I stained some furniture out there this afternoon.,,,
7404,Claire ," Of course you did, dad. Anything else I need to know about? Maybe the neighbors on either side are having a paintball fight. Now, watch this. Dad, in his infinite wisdom, stained furniture today. Don't touch it. It's wet. Hurry, hurry!",,,
7405,Phil ," Put that down, sweetheart.",,,
7406,Claire ," Okay, okay, we got it. Now we're gonna go out here. We're ready. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!",,,
7407,Jay ," Ay. All right, how do you... How do you turn the sprinklers off?",,,
7408,Gloria ," Ay, of course, because I'm Latina, I'm supposed to know everything about gardening and sprinklers!",,,
7409,Jay , You were here when they installed it!,,,
7410,Gloria ," Ay, yeah. Ay... The box is across the yard.",,,
7411,Claire , You mean the now-soaking-wet yard? That's great. We are screwed.,,,
7412,Phil ," No, we're not. We haven't unwrapped our secret weapon yet. Luke walks over there, ""hurt locker""-style, Flips the switch, and boom!... Or, not boom... water off. Put the ""he"" in ""hero,"" son.",,,
7413,Claire , Ohh.,,,
7414,Cameron ," ""hurt locker."" It's... it's more like ""squirt locker."" Really? That wasn't funny? I actually pity you guys.",,,
7415,Claire , No! No time to celebrate! Stop it! We don't have a lot of time.,,,
7416,Photographer ," All right, everybody, if I can have the little ones out front...",,,
7417,Claire ," You know what, sir? If you don't mind... I've got this. Come on, people. Let's get out here. Haley, Alex, I need you to unwrap your brother, all right? I need the Dunphys over on this side. Dad, you're in the middle. Mitchell, Cam, Lily on this end.",,,
7418,Phil , Okay. Listen.,,,
7419,Claire , Uh-huh?,,,
7420,Phil ," I know I screwed up, But if ever you're in my arms again... ",,,
7421,Claire ," Phil, not now.",,,
7422,Phil ," Yes, now! I don't want to look at this picture when I'm 80 years old and you're long dead and know that you were angry at me When we took it!",,,
7423,Claire ," Phil, we'll talk about what you did later.",,,
7424,Photographer ," Okay, everybody. Eyes over here.",,,
7425,Phil , I didn't do anything. She kissed me.,,,
7426,Claire , What?! Who kissed you?,,,
7427,Phil , Gloria.,,,
7428,Jay , What?!,,,
7429,Gloria , It was the kiss-cam.,,,
7430,Jay , Why did you kiss Cam?,,,
7431,Gloria ," No, I kissed Phil. He told me I had to.",,,
7432,Phil , No. No.,,,
7433,Claire , Okay. Hang on a second. Was this before or after you ignored the phone call from your wife?,,,
7434,Phil ," You saw that, too?!",,,
7435,Claire , Mm.,,,
7436,Jay , Could we please just take the damn picture?!,,,
7437,Photographer ," Okay, everybody, one more time.",,,
7438,Cameron ," Just so you know, I am angry with you.",,,
7439,Mitchell , I knew it!,,,
7440,Claire ," Oh, damn it!",,,
7441,Cameron ," It was a big day for me, and he didn't to go because he doesn't like small talk!",,,
7442,Claire , Would it be terribly inconvenient to just postpone this hissy fit for a few minutes?,,,
7443,Mitchell ," Okay, you know what?! Maybe some of us don't want to take a picture today!",,,
7444,Haley , Thank you!,,,
7445,Cameron ," Yeah, and, please, Claire, don't try to make Mitchell do something he doesn't want to do.",,,
7446,Mitchell ," Oh, shut up, Cam!",,,
7447,Claire ," Okay, stop it! Stop it! Everyone! Listen, this took me forever to put together, So I don't really care who kissed who and who's got a pimple on her head, And who is wearing an  outrageously inappropriate dress! We are gonna get together and act like a normal family for 1/10 of a freaking second, and we're gonna do it right now. Come on, let's go.",,,
7448,Mitchell , Get your hands off or me!,,,
7449,Claire ," No. No, make me. Make me. Make me.",,,
7450,Jay ," Oh, this is ridiculous! You're both uptight about everything! You didn't want to go to a wedding with him because you didn't want to make small talk? That's how I met Gloria. Do you remember the first thing I said to you?",,,
7451,Gloria ," Yes. ""I like chocolate, I like fruit, But not together.""",,,
7452,Jay ," You couldn't come up with that, Ivy league? And you... you would be a lot happier If you weren't so obsessed with everything being perfect. Look at us here all in white. What are we, a cricket team? News flash... life is not perfect, Claire. Now, calm the hell down!",,,
7453,Claire ," Okay, dad, that's great. And that's really easy for you to say, But do you think I like being like this? No, I don't. So if you have some quick and easy fix, Why don't you just give it to me right now? Ohh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!",,,
7454,Phil ," I-I got this, baby.",,,
7455,Claire , No! What are... Why did you do that? Two people are dirty!,,,
7456,Mitchell ," Well, three.",,,
7457,Cameron ," Okay, you know what? That's for ""kitschy.""",,,
7458,Luke , Mud fight!,,,
7459,Claire , No. Don't do that!,,,
7460,Photographer , Excuse me! Are we still doing this?,,,
7461,Claire ," No. No, we're not. Now we are.",,,
7462,Gloria , Ready!,,,
7463,Luke , Whoo-hoo!,,,
7464,Manny , Aah!,,,
7465,Photographer ," Say ""cheese.""",,,
7466,Gloria ," Say ""cheese!""",,,
7467,Jay ," Back in '68, when I was sweeping up hair in that barber shop, I had this mental picture of the family that, If I was lucky enough,  one day I would end up with... Perfect wife, perfect kids. Guess what. I didn't get any of that. I wound up with this sorry bunch. And I'm thankful for that every day. Well, most days.",,,
7468,Luke , I think I'm just gonna go with the Elvis stuff.,,,
7469,Jay ," Yeah, I would.",,,
7470,Claire , To the right...To the right...And a skosh to the left. There we go. Whatever. I'm gonna have to take the picture down when I repaint the wall anyhow.,,,
7471,Phil , Kill me now.,,,
7472,Claire , What?,,,
7473,Phil , Don't know how... I got so lucky.,,,
7474,Claire , Mm-hmm?,,,
7475,Phil , I love you.,,,
7476,Claire , I love that picture.,,,
7477,Phil , Yeah.,,,
7478,Claire , Is that a chip on the frame right there?,,,
7479,Phil , No. No.,,,
7480,Claire , I can see it.,,,
7481,Phil , Honey!   ,,,
